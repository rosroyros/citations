Before regenerating hundreds of pages, we need to:\n1. Confirm this is consistent across ALL production pages\n2. Understand which pages exist where (prod-only, dev-only, synced)\n3. Identify any edge cases or manual modifications\n4. Choose optimal regeneration strategy (full, partial, external CSS, etc.)\n\n## Specific Questions to Answer\n1. **Production inventory**: How many HTML pages exist on production? What directories/routes?\n2. **CSS methodology**: Do ALL pages use inline CSS, or are there external stylesheet links too?\n3. **Dev/prod parity**: Does folder structure match? Are there orphaned pages in prod?\n4. **Font declarations**: Current font-family values (verify consistency)\n5. **Page generation**: Which pages were generated vs manually copied?\n6. **External assets**: Where are CSS/JS assets stored? (/assets/css/*, /app-assets/*, etc.)\n\n## Deliverables\n- Inventory of production HTML pages (count, paths, types)\n- CSS loading methodology report (inline vs external breakdown)\n- Dev/prod file structure comparison\n- List of any anomalies or edge cases\n- Recommendation on regeneration approach\n\n## Success Criteria\nClear decision on how to proceed with PSEO font migration based on evidence.","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:43:25.26165+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T18:03:31.139403+02:00","labels":["fonts"]}
