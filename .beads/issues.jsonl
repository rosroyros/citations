This severely impacts:\n- **SEO**: Search engines struggle to discover these pages (poor crawl depth)\n- **User navigation**: Users can't find these pages except via Google/direct URL\n- **PageRank distribution**: No internal link equity flowing to these pages\n\n## Orphaned Pages Breakdown\n\n**Examples of high-value orphaned pages:**\n- `/guide/apa-graduate-students/` - Comprehensive guide, but nobody links to it\n- `/guide/apa-title-page/` - Important guide, zero links\n- `/guide/apa-reference-list/` - Critical guide, zero links\n- `/cite-nature-apa/` - Specific source pages (most of the 195 PSEO pages)\n- `/cite-science-apa/` - Similar issue\n- And 230+ more pages...\n\n## What \"Orphaned\" Means\nA page exists in production, but no other page on the site links to it. Users/search engines can only reach it via:\n- Direct URL entry\n- Google search results\n- External links\n\n## Potential Strategies\n\n### Option 1: Add \"Related Resources\" to PSEO Template (Medium effort)\nUpdate PSEO template to include links to mega-guides in footer/sidebar:\n- \"APA Graduate Student Guide\" → `/guide/apa-graduate-students/`\n- \"Reference List Formatting\" → `/guide/apa-reference-list/`\n- \"Title Page Requirements\" → `/guide/apa-title-page/`\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, gives mega-guides immediate link authority\n**Cons**: Doesn't help specific source pages link to each other\n**Regeneration**: ✅ YES - all PSEO pages\n\n### Option 2: Smart Related Content System (High effort)\nBuild algorithm to suggest related specific sources:\n- For medical journals → suggest other medical journals\n- For physics journals → suggest other physics journals\n- Use journal categories/disciplines\n\n**Pros**: Actually helpful to users, improves internal linking structure\n**Cons**: Requires categorization system and development work\n**Regeneration**: ✅ YES - all PSEO pages + new logic\n\n### Option 3: Just Remove Orphan Problem for Mega-Guides (Low effort)\nOnly fix the ~15 mega-guides by adding them to:\n- Main site footer (Footer.jsx)\n- PSEO template \"Related Guides\" section\n\nLeave specific source pages orphaned (they'll get traffic from Google anyway)\n\n**Pros**: Fast, targets highest-value content\n**Cons**: Doesn't fix 85% of orphans\n**Regeneration**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Footer.jsx changes (no regen), PSEO template changes (regen required)\n\n### Option 4: Defer for Now\nTrack this issue but don't fix yet. Focus on higher priority broken links first.\n\n## Investigation Required\n1. Categorize orphaned pages by type and priority\n2. Review competitors' internal linking strategies\n3. Estimate SEO impact of each approach\n4. Decide which strategy to pursue\n\n## Data Available\nFull list of 235 orphaned pages in `seo_link_health_report.json`\n\n## Decision Needed\nWhich strategy should we pursue? Or combination?\n\n## Impact\nPotential 50-100% increase in organic traffic from improved crawlability and internal link structure","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-07T09:31:05.450023+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-07T09:31:05.450023+02:00","labels":["intralink-validation","seo"]}

Only 5 routes are defined: `/`, `/success`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact`\n\nAny URL not matching these routes shows a blank page, even though nginx could serve static PSEO pages for those URLs.\n\n## Solution\n\nRevert to the previous conditional rendering pattern (before commit 044814d) but extend it to support the new pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact`).\n\n### Before (worked fine):\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  if (window.location.pathname === '/success') {\n    return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cSuccess /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n  }\n  return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cAppContent /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### After (proposed fix):\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'\n// REMOVE: import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'\nimport StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'\nimport Underline from '@tiptap/extension-underline'\nimport { CreditDisplay } from './components/CreditDisplay'\nimport { UpgradeModal } from './components/UpgradeModal'\nimport { PartialResults } from './components/PartialResults'\nimport Footer from './components/Footer'\nimport { getToken, getFreeUsage, incrementFreeUsage } from './utils/creditStorage'\nimport { CreditProvider, useCredits } from './contexts/CreditContext'\nimport { trackEvent } from './utils/analytics'\nimport { useAnalyticsTracking } from './hooks/useAnalyticsTracking'\nimport Success from './pages/Success'\nimport PrivacyPolicy from './pages/PrivacyPolicy'\nimport TermsOfService from './pages/TermsOfService'\nimport ContactUs from './pages/ContactUs'\nimport './App.css'\n\n// ... AppContent function stays the same ...\n\nfunction App() {\n  const pathname = window.location.pathname\n  \n  if (pathname === '/success') {\n    return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cSuccess /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n  }\n  if (pathname === '/privacy') {\n    return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cPrivacyPolicy /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n  }\n  if (pathname === '/terms') {\n    return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cTermsOfService /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n  }\n  if (pathname === '/contact') {\n    return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cContactUs /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n  }\n\n  // Default: main app (lets nginx handle PSEO pages)\n  return \u003cCreditProvider\u003e\u003cAppContent /\u003e\u003c/CreditProvider\u003e\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior After Fix\n\n1. ✅ `/` (root) → Shows main citation checker (AppContent)\n2. ✅ `/success` → Success page\n3. ✅ `/privacy` → Privacy Policy page\n4. ✅ `/terms` → Terms of Service page\n5. ✅ `/contact` → Contact Us page\n6. ✅ `/how-to-cite-book-apa/` → nginx serves PSEO static page\n7. ✅ `/cite-developmental-psychology-apa/` → nginx handles (404 if doesn't exist)\n8. ✅ `/guide/apa-7th-edition/` → nginx serves PSEO static page\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Edit `frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx`\n2. Remove React Router imports\n3. Replace `App()` function with conditional rendering pattern\n4. Remove `\u003cRouter\u003e`, `\u003cRoutes\u003e`, `\u003cRoute\u003e` JSX\n5. Build: `npm run build`\n6. Deploy\n\n## Testing Before Announcing Fixed\n\n### Local Testing (before deploy):\n```bash\ncd frontend/frontend\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nTest in browser:\n- [ ] http://localhost:5173/ shows citation checker\n- [ ] http://localhost:5173/success shows success page\n- [ ] http://localhost:5173/privacy shows privacy policy\n- [ ] http://localhost:5173/terms shows terms page\n- [ ] http://localhost:5173/contact shows contact page\n- [ ] Console has no React Router errors\n- [ ] Footer links work (Privacy, Terms, Contact)\n- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work\n\n### Production Testing (after deploy):\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/ shows citation checker\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/success shows success page\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/privacy shows privacy policy\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/terms shows terms page\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/contact shows contact page\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/how-to-cite-book-apa/ shows PSEO page (NOT blank)\n- [ ] https://citationformatchecker.com/guide/apa-7th-edition/ shows guide (NOT blank)\n- [ ] Console has no errors on any page\n- [ ] All footer links work across all pages\n- [ ] Submit citation on main page still works\n\n### Edge Case Testing:\n- [ ] Direct URL navigation works (paste URL in address bar)\n- [ ] Links from external sites work correctly\n- [ ] Browser refresh works on all pages\n- [ ] Analytics events still fire correctly (check console for trackEvent calls)\n\n## Benefits\n\n- ✅ Removes React Router dependency\n- ✅ Nginx naturally handles PSEO pages\n- ✅ Simple, proven pattern\n- ✅ No routing conflicts\n\n## Note\n\nThis does NOT fix missing PSEO pages (e.g., `cite-developmental-psychology-apa` doesn't exist in production). That's a separate content generation issue.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T19:30:33.56095+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T20:00:27.170711+02:00","closed_at":"2025-11-05T20:00:27.170711+02:00","labels":["approved"]}

What directories/routes?\n2. **CSS methodology**: Do ALL pages use inline CSS, or are there external stylesheet links too?\n3. **Dev/prod parity**: Does folder structure match? Are there orphaned pages in prod?\n4. **Font declarations**: Current font-family values (verify consistency)\n5. **Page generation**: Which pages were generated vs manually copied?\n6. **External assets**: Where are CSS/JS assets stored? (/assets/css/*, /app-assets/*, etc.)\n\n## Deliverables\n- Inventory of production HTML pages (count, paths, types)\n- CSS loading methodology report (inline vs external breakdown)\n- Dev/prod file structure comparison\n- List of any anomalies or edge cases\n- Recommendation on regeneration approach\n\n## Success Criteria\nClear decision on how to proceed with PSEO font migration based on evidence.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:43:25.26165+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T10:41:17.666873+02:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T10:41:17.666875+02:00","labels":["fonts"],"comments":[{"id":5,"issue_id":"citations-l5x","author":"roy","text":"# PSEO CSS Architecture Investigation - Final Summary\n\n## Production Inventory\n- **Total HTML files**: 350\n- **PSEO pages**: 250+ in `/opt/citations/content/dist/`\n- **Production pages**: 7 in `/opt/citations/production/`\n- **Other files**: 93 (tests, utilities)\n\n## CSS Architecture Discovery\n**EXTERNAL CSS ONLY** - No inline CSS found:\n- All PSEO pages use external stylesheets:\n  - `/assets/css/styles.css` (main styles)\n  - `/assets/css/mini-checker.css` (interactive components)\n- Production CSS served from `/opt/citations/content/dist/assets/css/`\n- Template CSS at `/backend/pseo/builder/assets/css/styles.css` (identical 674 lines)\n\n## Font Architecture\n**SYSTEM FONTS ONLY** - No Google Fonts implemented:\n- Current font stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`\n- No Google Fonts imports in production or development\n- Font declarations in external CSS files\n\n## HTML Structure Analysis\n**PERFECT SEMANTIC SEPARATION** across all guide types:\n- **Headings**: `h1-h6` (main titles, sections, subsections)\n- **Body text**: `\u003cp\u003e` tags in content wrappers\n- **Citations**: `\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e` blocks, inline citation examples\n- **UI elements**: `.logo-text`, `.nav-links`, `button`, `textarea`\n\n## Font Migration Strategy\n\n### NO HTML REGENERATION REQUIRED\n\n**Simple 3-step process:**\n\n1. **Update PSEO template** (`backend/pseo/builder/templates/layout.html`):\n   - Add Google Fonts preconnect and stylesheet links\n\n2. **Update PSEO CSS** (`backend/pseo/builder/assets/css/styles.css`):\n   - Add CSS custom properties for Crimson Pro, Work Sans, JetBrains Mono\n   - Apply fonts: `var(--font-body)`, `var(--font-heading)`, `var(--font-mono)`\n\n3. **Deploy to production**:\n   - Copy updated CSS to `/opt/citations/content/dist/assets/css/styles.css`\n   - All 250+ PSEO pages inherit new fonts automatically\n\n## Key Advantages\n- **External CSS architecture** enables instant font updates\n- **Semantic HTML structure** provides clean targeting for font rules\n- **No individual HTML page modifications** needed\n- **Template-based system** ensures consistency across all pages\n\n## Recommendation\n**Proceed with font migration** - the architecture is optimized for this exact scenario.
