# MLA 9th Edition Citation Rules - Research Documentation

## Executive Summary

MLA 9th edition (2021) introduced a fundamental shift to a **"container" system** that provides a flexible, principle-based approach to citations rather than rigid source-specific rules. This system uses **9 core elements** that can be applied universally to any source type.

**Key Insight**: Unlike APA 7's emphasis on recency (author-date), MLA prioritizes **source location** (author-page) for textual analysis in humanities fields.

---

## Core Containers Concept

### What is a Container?

A **container** is the larger work that holds the source you're citing. Think of it as nested layers:

- An article (source) → published in a journal (container 1)
- That journal → accessed via JSTOR database (container 2)

### The 9 Core Elements

Apply these in order, omitting any that don't apply:

1. **Author** - Last name, First name (full name, not initials)
2. **Title of Source** - The specific work (in quotes or italics depending on type)
3. **Title of Container** - The larger work holding the source (italicized)
4. **Other Contributors** - Editors, translators, directors, etc.
5. **Version** - Edition number, director's cut, etc.
6. **Number** - Volume, issue, season, episode numbers
7. **Publisher** - Organization that produced/distributed the work
8. **Publication Date** - Full date (Day Month Year format)
9. **Location** - Page numbers, DOI, or URL

### Punctuation Rules

- **Period** after: Author, Title of Source
- **Comma** between all other elements within a container
- **Period** at the end of the complete citation

## MLA 9 vs. APA 7: Key Differences Comparison

| **Element** | **MLA 9** | **APA 7** |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Primary Use** | Humanities (literature, languages, cultural studies) | Social sciences (psychology, sociology, education) |
| **Philosophy** | Emphasizes **location** for textual analysis | Emphasizes **recency** for scientific research |
| **Reference List Title** | Works Cited | References |
| **Author Names** | Full first names (Smith, John A.) | Initials only (Smith, J. A.) |
| **In-Text Citations** | (Author Page) e.g., (Smith 23) | (Author, Year, Page) e.g., (Smith, 2022, p. 45) |
| **Multiple Authors (2)** | Smith and Jones | Smith & Jones (use ampersand) |
| **Multiple Authors (3+)** | Smith et al. | Smith et al. (same) |
| **Title Capitalization** | **Title Case** for ALL titles | **Sentence case** for articles/books, Title Case for journals |
| **Date Placement** | **END** (after publisher) | **EARLY** (after author, in parentheses) |
| **Article Titles** | In quotation marks | No quotation marks, sentence case |
| **URLs** | Optional, can omit http:// | Required for online sources, with DOI preferred |
| **Block Quotes** | 4+ lines of prose OR 3+ lines of poetry | 40+ words |
| **Title Page** | Usually none (header on first page) | Required (separate page with title, author, affiliation) |
| **Running Head** | Last name + page number (all pages) | Page number only for students |
| **Page Number Format** | Smith 1 | Just 1 |

### Critical Distinction

**MLA**: "When did the author say it?" → (Morrison 42)  
**APA**: "How recent is this research?" → (Morrison, 2020, p. 42)

## Common Citation Errors (Student Mistakes)

### In-Text Citation Errors

#### 1. Incorrect Author-Page Format
❌ **Wrong**: (Fitzgerald, p. 42) or (Fitzgerald, 42)  
✅ **Correct**: (Fitzgerald 42)

**Error**: Adding "p." or "pg." before page number, or comma between author and page

#### 2. Missing Page Numbers
❌ **Wrong**: Citing online PDFs without page numbers when they exist  
✅ **Correct**: Always include page numbers if available, even for digital sources

#### 3. "Dropped" Quotations
❌ **Wrong**: 
```
The economy was struggling. "Inflation reached record highs" (Chen 45).
```
✅ **Correct**: 
```
As economist Maria Chen observes, "Inflation reached record highs" (45).
```

**Error**: No introduction or context for quote

#### 4. Mismatch Between In-Text and Works Cited
❌ **Wrong**: In-text (Chen 45) but Works Cited starts with "Maria Chen"  
✅ **Correct**: Both must match on first word (either both "Chen" or both use title if no author)

#### 5. Sources Without Authors
❌ **Wrong**: ("Untitled" 23) or (n.d. 23)  
✅ **Correct**: ("Climate Change Effects" 23) - use shortened title in quotes

#### 6. Indirect Sources (Quoting from Another Source)
❌ **Wrong**: (Original Author 56)  
✅ **Correct**: (qtd. in Secondary Author 56)

**Note**: Name original author in text, cite source you actually read

#### 7. Incorrect "et al." Usage
❌ **Wrong**: (Moore, Smith, et al. 59)  
✅ **Correct**: (Moore et al. 59)

**Error**: Only first author before "et al."

---

### Works Cited Page Errors

#### 8. Incorrect Alphabetization
❌ **Wrong**: Alphabetizing by first name or random order  
✅ **Correct**: Alphabetize by FIRST letter of each entry (usually author's last name)

**Ignores**: Articles like "A", "An", "The" when sorting by title

#### 9. Missing Hanging Indents
❌ **Wrong**: All lines flush left  
✅ **Correct**: First line flush, subsequent lines indented 0.5 inches

#### 10. Incorrect Spacing
❌ **Wrong**: Single-spaced entries or extra blank lines between entries  
✅ **Correct**: Double-spaced throughout, including within and between entries

#### 11. Title Formatting Confusion
❌ **Wrong**: "Journal Article Title" (quotes for journal) or *Article Title* (italics for article)  
✅ **Correct**: 
- Shorter works (articles, chapters, poems, episodes) → **quotation marks**
- Complete works (books, journals, films, websites, TV series) → ***italics***

#### 12. Missing Access Dates for Changing Content
❌ **Wrong**: Wikis, dashboards, or frequently updated pages without access date  
✅ **Correct**: Add "Accessed Day Month Year" for unstable web content

#### 13. Punctuation Errors
❌ **Wrong**: 
```
Morrison Toni. Beloved; Knopf. 1987
```
✅ **Correct**: 
```
Morrison, Toni. Beloved. Knopf, 1987.
```

**Common errors**: Wrong separators, missing periods, commas in wrong places

#### 14. Container Confusion
❌ **Wrong**: Treating JSTOR as publisher instead of second container  
✅ **Correct**: Journal article → in *Journal Name* (container 1) → via JSTOR (container 2)

#### 15. Inaccurate Publication Details
- Wrong publisher names (abbreviating incorrectly)
- Missing volume/issue numbers for journals
- Wrong dates or formats (2024 vs. 5 Feb. 2024)

---

### General Formatting Errors

#### 16. Inconsistent Line Spacing
❌ **Wrong**: Single-spaced or extra spaces between paragraphs  
✅ **Correct**: Double-spacing throughout entire paper, no extra spacing

#### 17. Improper Header Format
❌ **Wrong**: 
- Page 1 or p. 1 in header
- Only page number without last name
- "Page 1" instead of just "1"

✅ **Correct**: 
- First page: Name, instructor, course, date (each on separate line, flush left)
- All pages: Last name and page number only (top right: "Smith 1")

#### 18. Incorrect Essay Title Formatting
❌ **Wrong**: **Bold**, *Italicized*, or "Quoted" essay title  
✅ **Correct**: Centered, standard Title Case, no special formatting

#### 19. Over-Reliance on Citation Generators
⚠️ **Warning**: Generators make mistakes! Common issues:
- Incorrect capitalization (sentence case instead of title case)
- Missing or wrong punctuation
- Improper container identification
- Wrong formatting for page numbers

**Best Practice**: Always verify against official MLA Handbook or Purdue OWL

#### 20. Ignoring Instructor-Specific Requirements
⚠️ **Critical**: Instructor requirements override general MLA guidelines
- Some instructors require access dates for ALL online sources
- Some require annotations or specific ordering
- **Always check assignment instructions first**

---

## Error Patterns Summary

### Most Critical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Title Case vs. Sentence Case** - MLA uses Title Case for EVERYTHING
2. **Full Names vs. Initials** - MLA uses full first names (Toni, NOT T.)
3. **Date Placement** - MLA puts date AFTER publisher, not after author
4. **Punctuation in Citations** - No "p." before page numbers, no comma between author-page
5. **Container Recognition** - Identify nested containers (article → journal → database)

### High-Risk Areas

- **Journal articles from databases** (two-container problem)
- **Sources without authors** (must use title in both in-text and Works Cited)
- **YouTube videos** (creator vs. uploader distinction)
- **Book chapters** (editor attribution, page ranges)
