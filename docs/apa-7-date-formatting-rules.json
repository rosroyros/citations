    "description": "In APA 7, the publication year for most sources is placed in parentheses following the author name. The year is followed by a period. This format applies to journal articles, books, and most other standard reference types. The year should be the actual publication year, not the copyright year when they differ. For edited books, use the year of publication of the specific edition you are citing. This format has remained consistent from APA 6 with minor clarification about copyright vs publication year.",

This applies to web pages with no date, undated manuscripts, or archival materials without clear dating. The (n.d.) appears in the same position as the year would and is followed by a period. This format is unchanged from APA 6, but APA 7 provides clearer guidance on when to use (n.d.) versus seeking approximate dates.",

This format is used for journal articles that have been accepted but not yet published, books under contract, or similar forthcoming works.

This applies to newspapers, magazines, blog posts, social media posts, and some online sources where the specific date is important for locating the source.

This format is used for classical works with uncertain dating spans, multi-volume works published over several years, or historical documents covering extended periods.
