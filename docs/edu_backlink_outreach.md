## Email Template

**Subject:** A tool that might help your students with citations

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well! I came across your [citation resources page]([LINK TO THEIR PAGE]) and thought you might appreciate hearing about a tool I built for my wife's PhD research — she liked it so much I am now making it available to students and researchers across the country.

It's called Citation Format Checker (https://citationformatchecker.com) — it helps students and researchers **validate** their APA 7th and MLA 9th citations before submitting papers. Students can try it completely free and see how much time it saves and how helpful it is (thousands already have!)

Here's why I think it could be valuable for your students:

- **Catches mistakes from citation generators** — Tools like EasyBib and Zotero often produce formatting errors (wrong capitalization, missing italics, incorrect punctuation). Students trust their output, but professors dock points for these mistakes. This tool catches them.
  
- **Saves hours of manual checking** — Instead of cross-referencing every citation against the style guide, students get instant feedback on what's wrong and how to fix it.

- **No account needed to try** — Just paste and check. Perfect for students who want to quickly verify their formatting.

If you think it might be helpful, I'd love for it to be included on your resources page. Either way, thanks for the work you do supporting student writers!

Best,
[Your name]
