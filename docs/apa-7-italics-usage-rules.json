    "description": "Book titles in the reference list should be italicized and use sentence case (capitalize only the first word, proper nouns, and after colons). The italicization applies to complete books, edited books, textbooks, and monographs. This formatting helps distinguish book titles from article or chapter titles within the same reference. Book subtitles should also be italicized and separated from the main title by a colon. This rule remains consistent with APA 6, but APA 7 provides clearer examples for different book types including electronic books and reports.",
