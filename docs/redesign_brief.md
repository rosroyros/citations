# Citation Format Checker — Redesign Brief

## 🎯 Goal
Make the site feel more professional and conversion-oriented — highlighting **speed**, **accuracy**, and **free access** while reducing generic messaging.

---

## 🧱 Overall Page Structure (High-Level Layout)
1. **Hero section (top fold)**
2. **What we check** *(replacing old “90.9% of papers have errors” block)*
3. **How it works** (with illustration)
4. **Why researchers choose us** (benefit cards)
5. **FAQ**
6. **Footer**

## 🏁 1. Hero Section (Top Fold)

### ✏️ New Copy & Hierarchy
**Headline:**  
> Stop wasting 5 minutes on every citation.

**Subtitle:**  
> Instantly check and correct APA 7th citations — for free.

**Yellow highlight (previous stat area):**  
> ✅ Check citations in under 3 seconds — always free.

**Input box:**  
Placeholder: *“Paste your citation here (APA 7th Edition)”*  
CTA button: *“Check my citation”*  
Micro-text below: *“No signup • Instant results • 100% free”*

**Illustration (right side):**  
Visual metaphor of a citation being scanned (red → green corrections). Doesn’t need to be legible — focus on showing “checking” and “fixing.”

### 💡 Reasoning
- Lead with **pain relief + speed**.  
- Highlight **free** early for trust.  
- Replace irrelevant stat (“90.9% of papers...”) with an emotionally satisfying performance claim.  
- Visual adds energy and clarity without text clutter.

## 🔍 2. “What We Check” Section

**Heading:**  
> What Citation Format Checker Finds  

**Bullets / mini-cards:**  
- ✅ Missing italics in titles  
- ✅ Incorrect capitalization in article names  
- ✅ Misplaced commas and periods  
- ✅ Wrong DOI / URL formatting  
- ✅ Missing retrieval dates  
- … + dozens more APA checks  

**Reasoning:**  
- Reframes from *problem awareness* → *capability confidence.*  
- Communicates coverage and precision at a glance.  
- Keeps reassurance high just before user input.

---

## ⚙️ 3. “How It Works” Section

**3 steps with icons or animation**
1️⃣ Paste your citations  
2️⃣ We scan them automatically  
3️⃣ Get instant corrections  

Include a simple flow illustration or animation showing red marks turning green.

**Reasoning:**  
- Builds understanding and trust (“how it actually works”).  
- Reinforces “speed + ease + no signup.”

---

## 💜 4. “Why Researchers Choose Citation Format Checker”

**Benefit cards:**
- **Save hours** – Instant, accurate checks.  
- **Catch generator errors** – Detects mistakes from Zotero/ChatGPT.  
- **Never lose points** – Submit confidently.  
- **Always free** – Unlimited checks, no registration.

**Reasoning:**  
- Directly addresses user goals (grades, time, reliability).  
- Creates credibility and emotional payoff.

---

## ❓ 5. FAQ Section
Keep concise and supportive. Add optional question:  
> “How is this different from ChatGPT?” → “Our tool follows APA 7th Edition rules exactly, ensuring 80 % higher accuracy.”

---

## ⚫ 6. Footer
Simple, quiet — copyright + privacy.  
(Optional: small trust line such as “Built by researchers, for researchers.”)

---

## 🧠 Design System / Visual Guidance

- **Colors:** Keep lavender/purple identity; use **yellow accent** only for key highlights (e.g., speed/free banner).  
- **Typography:** Large, clean sans serif; emphasize contrast between headline and body.  
- **Layout:** Maintain whitespace — feels modern and academic.  
- **Icons:** Minimal, soft-colored vector icons (green = correct, red = error).  
- **Tone:** Calm, precise, confident — not flashy.

## ✅ Summary of Key Shifts

| Element | Before | After | Why |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Yellow highlight | Generic stat about error frequency | “Check citations in under 3 seconds — always free.” | Encourages action; feels alive |
| Subtitle | General value | Explicitly mentions “for free” | Builds trust and clarity |
| “Common errors” | Problem statement | Capability showcase (“What we check”) | Shifts focus to solution strength |
| Mid-page layout | Repetitive | Sequential story (How it works → Why choose us) | Improves flow |
| Visuals | Minimal | Add “checking” illustration | Increases engagement, comprehension |
| Messaging vs ChatGPT | Missing | Subtle accuracy edge | Differentiates from general AI tools |

## 🧾 Designer / Developer Summary (for Notion or Figma)
> The redesign should make the homepage feel faster, more credible, and more purposeful. Lead with the *speed + free + accuracy* value in the hero section. Replace the old “90.9% of papers have errors” line with a short, confident micro-proof (“Check citations in under 3 seconds — always free”). Add an illustration to visually communicate “checking” and “correction.” Below the hero, keep a concise section showing *what we catch*, followed by a simple 3-step “How it works” flow and benefit cards. Use whitespace, calm typography, and minimal icons. Keep the tone professional, human, and trustworthy — not corporate or loud.
