# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: November 5, 2025**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to Citation Format Checker. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our citation validation service, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of material changes by posting the updated Terms on our website and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.

## 2. Description of Service

Citation Format Checker is a web-based service that helps users validate the formatting of academic citations. Our Service:

- Analyzes citation text submitted by users
- Identifies formatting errors and inconsistencies
- Provides detailed feedback and suggestions for corrections
- Supports multiple citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, and others)
- Offers both free and paid credit-based usage tiers

The Service uses artificial intelligence and language models to analyze citations. While we strive for accuracy, automated validation is not perfect and should be used as a helpful tool, not a replacement for manual review.

## 3. User Accounts and Credits

### Free Usage

The Service offers limited free usage for users without an account. Free usage is subject to daily limits and may be restricted based on service capacity.

### Credit System

Users may purchase credits to access additional validation capabilities. Credits are:
- Non-refundable once purchased
- Valid for 12 months from the date of purchase
- Non-transferable between users or accounts
- Consumed upon each citation validation request

### Account Security

If you create an account, you are responsible for:
- Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials
- All activities that occur under your account
- Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized access

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or engage in fraudulent activity.
