[Continue for 6-8 most common source types in this field]
```

**Example for Psychology:**
```markdown
## How to Cite Psychology Sources

### 1. Empirical Journal Articles

**Why this matters in psychology:**
Empirical research articles are the foundation of psychological science. These peer-reviewed studies present original research with methods, results, and discussion sections. Psychology students cite these more than any other source type.

**Basic format:**
```
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. Title of Journal, volume(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx
```

**Psychology-specific notes:**
- Many psychology journals require DOIs
- Pay attention to participant information in titles (e.g., "in adolescents")
- Sample size sometimes mentioned in title

**Example:**
Shrout, P. E., & Rodgers, J. L. (2018). Psychology, science, and knowledge construction: Broadening perspectives from the replication crisis. *Annual Review of Psychology*, *69*(1), 487-510. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011845

**In-text citation:**
- Parenthetical: (Shrout & Rodgers, 2018)
- Narrative: Shrout and Rodgers (2018)

**Common errors in psychology:**
- Forgetting issue number (required in APA 7)
- Not including DOI when available
- Using title case instead of sentence case for article title

### 2. Books and Edited Volumes

**Why this matters in psychology:**
Theoretical works, textbooks, and edited handbooks provide foundational knowledge and comprehensive reviews. Classic psychology texts remain highly cited decades after publication.

**Basic format:**
```
Author, A. A. (Year). Title of book. Publisher.
```

**Psychology-specific notes:**
- Many classic psychology books are reprinted - note original publication year
- Edited handbooks are common - cite specific chapters
- Treatment manuals and assessment guides follow book format

**Example:**
Kahneman, D. (2011). *Thinking, fast and slow*. Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

**In-text citation:**
- Parenthetical: (Kahneman, 2011)
- Narrative: Kahneman (2011)

[Complete Guide to Citing Books]

---

### 3. DSM-5 and Diagnostic Manuals

**Why this matters in psychology:**
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is essential for clinical psychology. Citations must specify the edition and section.

**Basic format:**
```
American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596
```

**Psychology-specific notes:**
- Always cite the full manual, not individual disorder entries
- Include edition in parentheses
- DSM-5-TR (text revision, 2022) is newest version
- First in-text citation includes abbreviation: (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013)

**Example:**
American Psychiatric Association. (2022). *Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders* (5th ed., text rev.). https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425787

**In-text citation:**
- First: (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022)
- Subsequent: (APA, 2022)
- Specific disorder: (APA, 2022, p. 189)

---

### 4. Psychological Tests and Measures

**Why this matters in psychology:**
Standardized tests and measurement scales require special citation formats. Include test name, version, and publisher.

**Basic format:**
```
Author, A. A. (Year). Name of test [Test/Scale/Inventory]. Publisher. URL
```

**Psychology-specific notes:**
- Cite the test manual, not the test itself
- Include version number if applicable
- For unpublished measures, cite the article describing development

**Example:**
Beck, A. T., Steer, R. A., & Brown, G. K. (1996). *Beck Depression Inventory–II* [Database record]. APA PsycTests. https://doi.org/10.1037/t00742-000

**In-text citation:**
- Parenthetical: (Beck et al., 1996)
- Narrative: Beck et al. (1996)

**Common errors:**
- Citing the test itself instead of the manual
- Forgetting version number (BDI-II vs BDI)
- Not including database information

| Challenge | What to Do | Example | Common Error |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| [Challenge 1] | [Solution] | [Brief example] | [Error] |
| [Challenge 2] | [Solution] | [Brief example] | [Error] |
```

**Example for Psychology:**
```markdown
## Citation Challenges in Psychology

### Challenge 1: Citing Psychological Tests

**The problem:**
Students often confuse citing the test itself vs. citing the test manual vs. citing research that uses the test. Each requires different formats.

**Why it happens:**
Tests are instruments, not publications. The citation depends on how you're using the test information.

**Solution:**
- If discussing the test generally → Cite the test manual
- If reporting test results → Cite the manual and note in methods
- If discussing test development → Cite the article describing development
- If test in database → Cite database record

**Example:**
Citing test manual:
Beck, A. T., Steer, R. A., & Brown, G. K. (1996). *Beck Depression Inventory–II*. Psychological Corporation.

Citing database record:
Beck, A. T., Steer, R. A., & Brown, G. K. (1996). *Beck Depression Inventory–II* [Database record]. APA PsycTests. https://doi.org/10.1037/t00742-000

---

### Challenge 2: Multiple Authors and Et Al.

**The problem:**
Psychology research often has 5-10 authors. Knowing when to use "et al." is confusing, especially after APA 7 changes.

**Why it happens:**
APA 6 and APA 7 have different rules. Many students learned the old way.

**Solution:**
APA 7 rule (simplified):
- 1-2 authors: List all names every time
- 3+ authors: Use "First Author et al." from first citation

**Examples:**
Two authors (always list both):
(Smith & Jones, 2020)

Three or more authors (use et al. every time):
First citation: (Johnson et al., 2020)
Subsequent: (Johnson et al., 2020)

---

### Challenge 3: Citing Case Studies

**The problem:**
Case studies in clinical psychology may have confidentiality concerns. How to cite without identifying the patient?

**Solution:**
- Published case studies: Cite as you would any article
- Unpublished cases: Cite as personal communication (not in reference list)
- Your own cases: Don't cite, describe in methods without identifiers

**Example:**
Published case study:
Schacter, D. L. (1996). *Searching for memory: The brain, the mind, and the past*. Basic Books.
