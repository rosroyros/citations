## 1. KNOWLEDGE BASE PURPOSE

### 1.1 Function
The Citation Rules Knowledge Base serves as the **single source of truth** for all citation formatting information across the site. It will be used to:

1. Generate consistent content across all page types
2. Power the citation checker validation logic
3. Provide structured data for templates
4. Enable automated content updates when rules change
5. Ensure accuracy and compliance with APA standards

### 1.2 Data Structure Philosophy

**Structured Format:**
- Machine-readable (JSON/YAML/database)
- Human-readable for editing
- Versioned for tracking changes
- Extensible for future citation styles

**Single Source, Multiple Uses:**
```
Knowledge Base
    ↓
    ├→ Content Generation (page text)
    ├→ Validation Logic (checker tool)
    ├→ Example Generation (formatted citations)
    └→ Error Detection (what's wrong)
```
