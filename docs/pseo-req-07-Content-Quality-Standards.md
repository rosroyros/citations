# Part 7: Content Quality Standards

## Core Quality Requirements

### Unique Value Per Page
- Each page must provide distinct, non-redundant information
- No duplicate content across citation style variations
- Unique examples, explanations, or angle for each error type
- Different wording/structure even when covering similar rules

### Template Variable Requirements
- Minimum 5 dynamic insertion points per template
- Variables must create substantive differences (not just word swaps)
- Context-aware content adjustment based on citation style
- Examples that change meaningfully per style/source type

### Content Depth Standards
- Minimum 800 words per page (excluding boilerplate)
- At least 3 detailed examples per error type
- Compare correct vs incorrect formatting
- Explain WHY the error matters (not just WHAT is wrong)
- Include edge cases and common variations

## Anti-Thin Content Measures

### Required Content Elements
- Original explanation (not paraphrased from style guide)
- Visual formatting examples (not just text description)
- Common student mistakes specific to that error
- Step-by-step correction process
- Related errors users should check

### Prohibited Patterns
- No pages that only restate the citation style rule
- No identical structure across 50+ pages with minimal variable changes
- No "list of rules" without explanation/examples
- No auto-generated content without human review/editing

### Quality Checks Before Launch
- Manual review of 20% sample across all templates
- Ensure no two pages read as near-duplicates
- Verify examples are accurate for the specific error type
- Confirm each page passes Copyscape/plagiarism detection

## User Value Validation
