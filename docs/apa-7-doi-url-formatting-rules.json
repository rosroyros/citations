This represents a significant change from APA 6, where DOIs were presented either as doi:10.xxxx/xxxxx or as full URLs beginning with http://dx.doi.org/. The new format ensures consistency and makes DOIs directly clickable in digital formats. When including a DOI in a reference, always format it as a live hyperlink without any additional punctuation or formatting.

    "source": "APA Manual Section 9.34, p. 298",
    "description": "APA 7 establishes a clear hierarchy for linking to online sources: always prefer DOI over URL when both are available. DOIs are considered permanent identifiers that provide more stable linking to scholarly content compared to URLs, which may change or become inaccessible. When a source has both a DOI and a URL, include only the DOI in your reference. This rule applies to journal articles, books, book chapters, and any other scholarly source that has been assigned a DOI. URLs should only be used when no DOI is available for the source. This preference system represents a clarification of APA 6 guidelines.",

APA 7 removes the 'Retrieved from' prefix that was required in APA 6 for most URLs.

The hyperlink text should be the full URL or DOI itself, not descriptive text like 'click here' or 'link'. In print publications, these links should appear in plain text but remain functional for readers who might type them into browsers.

Do not break URLs or DOIs across lines; if necessary, insert a line break before a forward slash or at a period. This ensures readability and functionality.",

If the source is available through an archive like the Internet Archive, include the archived URL. If the source cannot be located, include as much information as possible and note that the resource is no longer available. For journal articles with broken DOIs, include the DOI but add a note indicating it's inactive.

Most scholarly articles found in databases should be cited using their DOI rather than the database URL. Only include database information when the source is exclusive to that database and cannot be found elsewhere, such as with dissertations or some reports. This represents a major change from APA 6, where database names and retrieval information were commonly included.
