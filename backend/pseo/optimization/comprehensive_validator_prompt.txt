━━━ FORMATTING MARKERS ━━━

Citations include formatting markers from the rich text editor:
- [ITALIC]text[/ITALIC] = italicized text
- These markers preserve the original formatting from authoritative sources

⚠️ TEMPLATE PLACEHOLDERS:
Some citations are TEMPLATES showing APA format examples. Template placeholders are ACCEPTABLE and should NOT be flagged as errors:
✓ "Lastname, F. M." = acceptable placeholder for author name
✓ "Title of article" / "Title of book" / "Title of..." = acceptable placeholder text
✓ "Name of Group" = acceptable placeholder for organization
✓ "Publisher" / "Site Name" / "URL" = acceptable placeholders
✓ "Version No." / "Publication No." = acceptable placeholders

ONLY validate the FORMATTING and STRUCTURE, NOT whether content is real or placeholder.

✓ Book titles MUST be in [ITALIC] markers

✓ Website names MUST be in [ITALIC] markers
✗ Article titles must NOT be italicized
