FORMAT:
Return as JSON array:
[
  {
    "question": "Question text here?",
    "answer": "Answer text here with examples and explanation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Next question?",
    "answer": "Next answer."
  }
]

EXAMPLE:
[
  {
    "question": "Do I need to include the issue number in a journal citation?",
    "answer": "Only include the issue number if each issue of the journal starts at page 1. If the journal uses continuous pagination (where page numbers continue from issue to issue throughout the volume), you can omit the issue number. For example, if Volume 15, Issue 2 starts at page 200 (not page 1), you don't need the issue number. When in doubt, include itâ€”it's never wrong to add it."
  }
]
