    "description": "For sources from academic databases, APA 7 simplifies formatting by generally omitting database names and URLs. Most scholarly articles found in databases should be cited using their DOI rather than the database URL. Only include database information when the source is exclusive to that database and cannot be found elsewhere, such as with dissertations or some reports. This represents a major change from APA 6, where database names and retrieval information were commonly included. The principle is to provide the most direct and permanent path to the source, which is typically through the DOI rather than database-specific access information.",
