- Publication year in parentheses

- Article title in sentence case

## In-Text Citation Guidelines

In-text citations for journal articles include the author(s) and year. For two authors, include both names. For three or more authors, include the first author followed by 'et al.' Use narrative format (Author, Year) when the author is part of your sentence, or parenthetical format (Author, Year) at the end of the sentence.

**Narrative Citations:**

- Smith and Johnson (2023) found that...

- As Williams (2022) demonstrated...


**Parenthetical Citations:**

- Recent research supports this conclusion (Smith & Johnson, 2023).

- Previous studies have shown conflicting results (Williams, 2022).


**Multiple Authors:** Two authors: List both names. Three or more authors: Use first author's name followed by 'et al.' in all citations (APA 7 simplified this from APA 6).

**No Author/Datetime:** No author: Use title in place of author. No date: Use 'n.d.' Organization as author: Use organization name. Multiple works by same author: List in chronological order.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Identify the Author(s)**: List all authors up to 20. Format as Last Name, F. M. 2. **Find the Publication Year**: Locate the year in parentheses after author names. 3. **Copy the Article Title**: Use exact title, capitalizing only first word and proper nouns. 4. **Locate Journal Information**: Find the full journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers. 5. **Find the DOI**: Look for the DOI, usually on the first page or in database record. 6. **Format Everything**: Apply proper italics, punctuation, and spacing according to APA format. 7. **Double-Check**: Verify all elements are present and correctly formatted.

**What You'll Need:**

- Author names and initials

- Publication year

- Complete article title

- Full journal name

- Volume and issue numbers

- Page range or article number

- DOI or journal URL


**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes per citation

**Pro Tip:** Save time by using citation management software like Zotero or EndNote, but always double-check the formatting against APA 7 guidelines.

## Frequently Asked Questions


### How do I cite a journal article with more than 20 authors?

List the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. For example: Smith, J., Johnson, K., Williams, M., ... Brown, T. (2023).


**Example:** Smith, J., Johnson, K., Williams, M., Davis, R., ... Brown, T. (2023). Research methods overview. *Psychology Journal, 45*(2), 123-145.

### What if I can't find the DOI for a journal article?

First, search Crossref.org using the article title and author. If still no DOI found, include the journal's homepage URL. If the article is from a print-only journal, end the citation after the page range.



---


### Do I need to include database names in journal article citations?

Generally no, unless the article is from an exclusive database that's the only way to access it. In most cases, use DOI or journal URL instead.



---



## Expert Tips for Journal Article Citations


### Use Crossref for DOI Verification

Always verify DOIs through Crossref.org. This ensures accuracy and helps you spot fake or incorrect DOIs that sometimes appear in database records.


### Maintain a DOI Log

Keep a spreadsheet of DOIs for articles you frequently cite. This saves time and ensures consistency across your papers.



**Best Practice:** Always verify journal article information against the original source rather than relying solely on database records, which can contain formatting errors.

**Remember the 3 Most Important Rules:**

1. Article titles use sentence case (not title case)

2. Volume numbers are italicized, issue numbers are in parentheses

3. DOIs are formatted as clickable URLs (https://doi.org/...)
