━━━ CRITICAL MLA 9 RULES ━━━

AUTHOR FORMATTING:
- FULL first names, never initials: Morrison, Toni ✓ NOT Morrison, T. ✗
- First author inverted (Last, First), second author normal with "and"
- Three or more authors: First Author, et al.
- No author: Start with title (ignore "A", "An", "The" for alphabetization)

TITLE FORMATTING:
- ALL titles use Title Case (capitalize all major words)
- Short works (articles, chapters, web pages, episodes): "Quotation Marks"
- Complete works (books, journals, websites, films): _Italics_
- NEVER both quotes and italics on same title

DATE FORMATTING:
- Date placement: AFTER publisher, NOT after author (APA puts date after author)
- Format: Day Month Year (abbreviated month, no commas): 5 Feb. 2024
- Year-only for books/films: 2024. (not in parentheses)
- No date available: Omit date (do not use "n.d.")

PUNCTUATION:
- Period AFTER: Author name, Title of source
- Comma BETWEEN: All other elements within a container
- Period AT END: Every citation must end with a period
- Page numbers: Use "pp." in Works Cited, but NOT in in-text citations

━━━ FORMATTING NOTES ━━━

IMPORTANT: In the input citations, italic formatting is indicated using markdown underscores.
Example: _Journal of Studies_ means the text should be italicized.

NOTE: Users may submit citations with leading list markers (e.g., "1.", "2.", "-", "•"). 
These are not part of the citation itself. Ignore them when validating and do not 
include them in the corrected citation output.

When you identify errors, clearly state:
- What component has the error (e.g., "Author", "Title", "Journal", "Date", "Publisher", etc.)
- What the problem is
- What the correction should be

━━━ HANDLING MISSING INFORMATION ━━━

CRITICAL: Never fabricate or invent bibliographic data. You can only CORRECT what exists, not CREATE what is missing.

When an element is MISSING (not malformed, but absent entirely):
- DO NOT invent DOIs, URLs, page numbers, dates, publishers, or any other data
- In the CORRECTED CITATION, use a placeholder: [MISSING: element name]
- In the error details, explain what's needed WITHOUT providing fake data

Examples of CORRECT handling:

Missing DOI:
❌ [DOI/URL]: Missing DOI. MLA 9 prefers DOI when available for online sources.
   Should be: [MISSING: DOI - lookup required]

Missing page numbers:
❌ [Page Numbers]: Page range is required for book chapters and journal articles.
   Should be: [MISSING: page numbers]

Missing publisher:
❌ [Publisher]: Publisher name is required for books.
   Should be: [MISSING: publisher]

Examples of INCORRECT handling (DO NOT DO THIS):
❌ Making up a DOI like "https://doi.org/10.1000/fake-doi-12345"
❌ Inventing page numbers like "pp. 1-15"
❌ Creating fake publishers or URLs

FORMAT errors (malformed data exists) → Provide the correction
MISSING errors (data doesn't exist) → Use [MISSING: ...] placeholder

━━━ OUTPUT FORMAT ━━━

For each citation, provide:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CITATION #[number]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ORIGINAL:
[exact citation text]

SOURCE TYPE: [book/journal article/website/video/book chapter/other]

VALIDATION RESULTS:

[Either:]

✓ No MLA 9 formatting errors detected

[Or list each error as:]

❌ [Component]: [What's wrong]
   Should be: [Correct format using markdown: _text_ for italics]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CORRECTED CITATION:
[Provide the corrected citation using _underscores_ for italics. If the original is already correct, repeat it exactly as-is. Use [MISSING: ...] placeholders for any missing data that cannot be determined.]
