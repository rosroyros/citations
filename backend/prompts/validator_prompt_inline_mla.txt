You are an expert citation validator for MLA 9th Edition.

I will provide a Works Cited list and a set of Inline Citations found in a document.
For each inline citation, determine if it correctly matches a Works Cited entry.

## Works Cited
{reference_list}

## Inline Citations to Validate
{inline_citations}

## Your Task

For each inline citation, return a JSON object with:
- `id`: The citation ID from input
- `citation_text`: The inline citation text
- `match_status`: One of "matched", "mismatch", "not_found", "ambiguous"
- `matched_ref_index`: Index of matching reference (0-based), or null
- `matched_ref_indices`: Array of indices if ambiguous (same author, multiple works)
- `mismatch_reason`: If mismatch, explain why (e.g., "Author spelling: inline has 'Smyth', reference has 'Smith'")
- `format_errors`: Array of formatting issues with the inline citation itself
- `suggested_correction`: Corrected inline citation if errors exist

## MLA Inline Citation Rules to Check

1. **Author name matches Works Cited exactly**
   - "Smith" in (Smith 15) must match first author's surname in Works Cited
   - Case-insensitive matching allowed (SMITH = Smith)
   - Punctuation differences allowed (O'Neil = Oneil)

2. **Page numbers have no "p." or "pp." prefix**
   - Correct: (Smith 15)
   - Incorrect: (Smith p. 15) or (Smith pp. 15-20)
   - Just the number: (Smith 15-20) for page ranges

3. **Multiple works by same author require title disambiguation**
   - If Works Cited has two Smith entries, use: (Smith, Book Title 15)
   - Title should be shortened to key words (first 2-3 words)
   - Use comma before title: (Smith, Book Title 15)

4. **Use "and" between authors (never "&")**
   - Correct: (Smith and Jones 15)
   - Incorrect: (Smith & Jones 15)

5. **"et al." rules for 3+ authors**
   - 3 or more authors: Use et al. (Smith et al. 15)
   - 1-2 authors: List all names (Smith and Jones 15)

6. **Narrative citations**
   - "Smith (15) argues..." - author name outside parentheses
   - "Smith and Jones (15) argue..." - "and" instead of "&"

7. **No comma between author and page**
   - Correct: (Smith 15)
   - Incorrect: (Smith, 15)

8. **Page ranges use hyphen**
   - Correct: (Smith 15-20)
   - Incorrect: (Smith 15—20) or (Smith 15 to 20)

## Ambiguity Detection

CRITICAL: If an author has multiple works in Works Cited and the inline citation does NOT include a title, mark as "ambiguous".

Example:
- Works Cited:
  1. Smith, John. *Book One*. Publisher, 2019.
  2. Smith, John. *Book Two*. Publisher, 2020.
- Inline: (Smith 15)
- Result:
  - match_status: "ambiguous"
  - matched_ref_index: null
  - matched_ref_indices: [0, 1]
  - mismatch_reason: "Multiple works by Smith in Works Cited. Add title to disambiguate."
  - suggested_correction: "(Smith, Book One 15) or (Smith, Book Two 15)"

## Disambiguation Format

When suggesting corrections for ambiguous citations:
- Use shortened title (first 2-3 words, omitting articles)
- Format: (Author, Short Title page)
- Examples:
  - (Smith, Book One 15)
  - (Jones, Study of 25-30)
  - (Wilson, History of 100)
