CITATION:
{citation}

YOUR PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT:
Decision: VALID (no errors detected)

SELF-REVIEW TASK:
Double-check for subtle formatting issues that are easy to miss.

COMMON MISSED ERRORS - CHECK EACH:

PUNCTUATION:
□ Space before DOI: Is there ". https://doi.org"? (should be "https://doi.org" - no space)
□ Period before URL: Is there "Source. https://"? (should be "Source https://" in some contexts)
□ Volume/issue italics: For journals, is volume italic but issue NOT? (e.g., _13_(3) not _13(3)_)

FORMATTING:
□ Title capitalization: Are mid-sentence words lowercase? (e.g., "storybooks" not "Storybooks")
□ DOI format: Does it use "https://doi.org/" not "doi:"?
□ Publisher location: Is there a location before publisher? (APA 7 removed these: "New York, NY:")

If you find ANY of these issues, the citation is INVALID.

FINAL DECISION: VALID or INVALID
REASONING: Explain what you checked and if you found any missed errors.
