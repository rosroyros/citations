In APA 7, if a work does not have a personal author, the title can be used as the author. However, it should be italicized.\n   - **Required or Preferred:** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation:** Using the title as the author is acceptable in APA 7.\n   - **Impact on Validity:** This does not make the citation INVALID, but it should be italicized.\n\n2. **Publication Year:**\n   - **Assessment:** The year \"2017\" appears to refer to the online version, but it is not clear if this is the correct publication year for the online version or if it should reflect the original publication year.\n   - **Required or Preferred:** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation:** The year of the online version is acceptable, but clarity is needed.\n   - **Impact on Validity:** This could lead to confusion but does not make the citation INVALID.\n\n3. **Source Title Formatting:**\n   - **Assessment:** The title \"King James Bible Online\" should be italicized as it is the title of the website.\n   - **Required or Preferred:** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation:** Titles of websites should be italicized.\n   - **Impact on Validity:** This does not make the citation INVALID, but it should be corrected.\n\n4. **URL Formatting:**\n   - **Assessment:** The URL is correctly formatted, but there should be no period at the end of the URL.\n   - **Required or Preferred:** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation:** No period should follow the URL.\n   - **Impact on Validity:** This does not make the citation INVALID, but it should be corrected.\n\n5. **Original Work Published Note:**\n   - **Assessment:** The note \"(Original work published: 1769)\" is not formatted correctly according to APA 7 guidelines. It should be placed in the reference entry in a specific format.\n   - **Required or Preferred:** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation:** The note should be formatted correctly.\n   - **Impact on Validity:** This does make the citation INVALID due to incorrect formatting.\n\n### FINAL DECISION: INVALID\n\n**REASONING:** \nWhile some elements of the citation are acceptable variations under APA 7, the citation ultimately fails to meet the required formatting for the original publication note and the italicization of the title and website. These errors collectively lead to the conclusion that the citation is INVALID. To correct it, the citation should be formatted as follows:\n\n**Corrected Citation:**\n_King James Bible_.

T. 1991 The nomological validity of the Type A personality among employed adults _Journal of Applied Psychology_ 76 1 143\u2013168\n\n### Errors Identified:\n1. **Author Formatting**: The authors' names should be formatted with commas separating them, and an ampersand (&) should be used before the last author's name.\n2. **Year Formatting**: The year should be in parentheses.\n3. **Title Formatting**: The title of the article should be in sentence case (only the first word and proper nouns capitalized).\n4. **Journal Title Formatting**: The journal title should be italicized and in title case.\n5. **Volume and Issue Formatting**: The volume number should be italicized, and the issue number should be in parentheses (not italicized).\n6. **Page Range Formatting**: The page range should be preceded by \"pp.\" if it is a book or report, but for journal articles, it is typically just the page numbers without \"pp.\".\n\n### Analysis of Each Error:\n1. **Author Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the correct format is necessary.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n2. **Year Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the year must be in parentheses.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n3. **Title Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the title must be in sentence case.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n4. **Journal Title Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the journal title must be italicized and in title case.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n5. **Volume and Issue Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the volume must be italicized, and the issue must be in parentheses.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n6. **Page Range Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Preferred guideline.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: Yes, page numbers can be listed without \"pp.\" for journal articles.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: No, this does not make the citation invalid.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**INVALID**\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe citation is invalid due to multiple required formatting errors, including incorrect author formatting, year formatting, title formatting, and journal title formatting. Each of these errors is a violation of APA 7 rules, and collectively they render the citation invalid. The only aspect that does not affect validity is the page range formatting, which is acceptable as is. Therefore, the overall assessment remains that the citation is invalid. \n\n### Corrected Citation:\nGanster, D. C., Schaubroeck, J., Sime, W. E., & Mayes, B. T. (1991).

Therefore, the citation needs to be revised to correct these issues. \n\n### Suggested Revision:\nSvendsen, S., L\u00f8ber, L., & Jensen, M.

This is a preferred guideline rather than a strict requirement.\n   - **Conclusion**: This does not make the citation invalid.\n\n3. **Title Formatting**\n   - **Assessment**: The title is italicized and correctly capitalized according to APA 7 guidelines.\n   - **Decision**: This is correct formatting.\n   - **Conclusion**: This does not make the citation invalid.\n\n4. **Additional Information in Parentheses**\n   - **Assessment**: The additional information about amendments is included in parentheses. While this is not a common practice, it does provide context.\n   - **Decision**: This is an acceptable variation under APA 7, as long as it does not detract from the clarity of the citation.\n   - **Conclusion**: This does not make the citation invalid.\n\n5. **URL Formatting**\n   - **Assessment**: The URL is provided correctly and does not have any punctuation before it.\n   - **Decision**: This is correct formatting.\n   - **Conclusion**: This does not make the citation invalid.\n\n### FINAL DECISION: VALID\n\n**REASONING**: Upon reconsideration, the citation adheres to APA 7 guidelines. The author name is valid, the publication date reflects the most recent amendment, the title is correctly formatted, the additional information is acceptable, and the URL is correctly presented. None of the identified issues constitute a violation of APA 7 rules that would render the citation invalid. Therefore, I confirm that the citation is valid."}

Bible.\"**\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?**: This is a REQUIRED rule. The author name should typically follow the format of \"Last, F.\" \n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?**: \"J. Bible\" could be interpreted as a mononym, but it is unconventional to include a middle name or initial in this format.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?**: While it is unconventional, it does not strictly violate APA rules. However, it may cause confusion.\n\n2. **Publication Year: (2017)**\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?**: This is a REQUIRED rule. The publication year should reflect the date of the version being cited.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?**: No, the year should accurately reflect the publication of the version being cited.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?**: If the citation is referring to the online version published in 2017, this is acceptable. However, if it is meant to refer to the original work, it should be noted differently.\n\n3. **Title Formatting: \"King James Bible Online.\"**\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?**: This is a REQUIRED rule. Titles should be in italics and in sentence case.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?**: No, the title should be italicized.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?**: Yes, this is a formatting error that should be corrected.\n\n4. **URL Formatting: \"https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/\"**\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?**: This is a REQUIRED rule.

It is not required to include the original publication date.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?**: Yes, it is acceptable to include this information.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?**: No, this does not invalidate the citation.\n\n### FINAL DECISION: INVALID\n\n**REASONING:** \nThe citation is invalid primarily due to the incorrect formatting of the title, which should be italicized. Additionally, the author name format is unconventional, which could lead to confusion, but it does not strictly violate APA rules. The publication year is acceptable if it refers to the online version, but it should be clarified. Therefore, while some elements are acceptable variations, the citation does not meet the necessary formatting requirements for a valid APA citation."}

These errors misrepresent the source type and violate APA formatting rules, which are critical for accurate citation. Therefore, the citation remains invalid."}

M. (2017). _Behave: The biology of humans at our best and worst_. Penguin Books.\n\n### Potential Errors Identified:\n\n1. **Author Name Format:**\n   - **Assessment:** The author is listed as \"R. M. Sapolsky.\"\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?** This is a REQUIRED rule; the format should be \"Last, F. M.\" or \"Last, F. M. M.\"\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?** No, the initials should be in the correct order.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?** Yes, this is a significant error.\n\n2. **Italics for Book Title:**\n   - **Assessment:** The book title is italicized correctly.\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?** No, the title must be italicized.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?** No, this part is correct.\n\n3. **Publisher Name:**\n   - **Assessment:** The publisher is listed as \"Penguin Books.\"\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?** This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?** No, the publisher's name must be accurate.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?** No, this part is correct.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**INVALID**\n\n### REASONING:**\nUpon reconsideration, the primary error lies in the author name format. The initials should be presented in the correct order as \"R. M. Sapolsky\" rather than \"Sapolsky, R. M.\" This is a significant error that affects the validity of the citation. The other components of the citation are correct, but the author name format is a critical aspect of APA style. Therefore, the citation remains invalid due to this error."}
