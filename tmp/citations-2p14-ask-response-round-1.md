Perfect! Now I understand the current setup. Based on your requirements, I need to create 3 landscape-oriented glassmorphism variants that:

1. **Table dimensions**: 280px height × 1036px width  
2. **Current implementation**: Vertical layout with 400px width content centered
3. **Goal**: Expand horizontally while maintaining the 280px height constraint

Let me ask a few clarifying questions to ensure I design the perfect variants:

**Question 1**: For the landscape orientation, should the content be:
- A) Spread across the full width (1036px) with elements arranged horizontally
- B) Take up more width but still centered (maybe 600-700px instead of 400px)
- C) Asymmetric layout with more visual interest using the horizontal space

**Question 2**: How do you feel about including some of the blurred table content as part of the landscape design? For example:
- A) Keep table completely blurred in background
- B) Show subtle glimpses of table data through the glassmorphism
- C) Create a split view with some table visible alongside the gated content

**Question 3**: Which layout direction feels right for the horizontal arrangement?
- A) Icon → Title/Summary → Button (left to right flow)
- B) Icon/Title centered → Summary/Button on the right  
- C) More creative approach with overlapping elements and diagonal flow

Once I understand your preferences, I can create three distinct variants that take full advantage of the landscape format while preserving the glassmorphism aesthetic!
