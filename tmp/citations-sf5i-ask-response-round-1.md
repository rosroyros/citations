## **Implementation Order (Simplest First)**

1. **Phase 1**: Add Chart.js and create basic time series chart
   - Easiest to implement
   - Immediate value

2. **Phase 2**: Add provider comparison chart
   - Important for A/B testing insights
   - Uses existing data

3. **Phase 3**: Add user type and citation distribution charts
   - Complete the picture

4. **Phase 4**: Performance monitoring chart
   - Advanced insights

## **Performance Impact**

- **Minimal**: Chart.js runs client-side
- **Database**: Pre-aggregation reduces query load
- **Network**: Small JSON payloads (< 10KB each)
- **CPU**: Negligible chart rendering

## **Next Steps**

Would you like me to:
1. Start implementing Phase 1 (time series chart)?
2. Create the API endpoints first?
3. Set up a specific chart from the list?

The approach prioritizes simplicity while delivering immediate value through visual insights about your validation patterns and A/B testing performance.
