Context: PartialResults.jsx shows locked/partial results for free tier users who hit limits. For A/B test variants 1.2 and 2.2, pricing is shown INLINE (not in a modal). When inline checkout succeeds, we need to show a success state that makes sense.

PROBLEM WITH ORIGINAL PLAN:
Just showing a success banner while locked results are still visible is BAD UX. User sees "Payment Successful!" but also still sees their locked results below - confusing!

REVISED SOLUTION:
After inline checkout succeeds:
1. HIDE the locked/partial results (they're now stale - user has credits!)
2. Show success message prominently
3. Show clear CTA: "Validate Your Citations Now" button
4. Clicking button re-submits their citations (or scrolls to editor)

This is SIMPLER than auto-resubmit (no complex state management) but provides clear next step for user.

Current State:
- PartialResults renders PricingTableCredits or PricingTablePasses inline for variants 1.2/2.2
- Uses onCheckout prop to pass to pricing components
- After purchase, user was redirected to /success page

New Behavior:
- Checkout happens in embedded iframe over the page
- On success:
  1. Call refreshCredits() from CreditContext
  2. Set inlineCheckoutSuccess = true
  3. HIDE the locked results and pricing table
  4. Show success state with CTA

Success State UI:
  if (inlineCheckoutSuccess) {
    return (
      <div className="inline-checkout-success">
        <div className="success-icon">✅</div>
        <h3>Payment Successful!</h3>
        <p>Your {purchasedItem} is now active.</p>
        <Button onClick={scrollToEditorAndFocus}>
          Validate Your Citations Now
        </Button>
      </div>
    );
  }

Changes Required:
1. Add inlineCheckoutSuccess state
2. Add purchasedProductName state (to show what they bought)
3. Pass onCheckoutSuccess callback to PricingTable components with product info
4. On success: set states, hide old results, show CTA
5. CTA button scrolls to editor (or triggers re-validation)

Why NOT auto-resubmit:
- Adds complexity (need to preserve original citations somewhere)
- User might want to modify citations before re-validating
- Simpler is better for v1

Dependencies:
- Requires: checkoutFlow.js refactor (citations-oaed)
- Parallel with: UpgradeModal and PricingTable updates

Testing: Add E2E test for inline checkout success flow
