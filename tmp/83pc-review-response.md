## Review Complete

The implementation shows good architectural design and separation of concerns, but has a **critical blocker**: the content generation uses placeholder HTML instead of real MLA-specific content. Additionally, there are security vulnerabilities and missing dependencies that must be addressed before deployment.

**Recommendation: DO NOT DEPLOY** until Issue #8 (real content generation) and security issues (#22-24) are resolved.

Would you like me to create beads issues for the P0 fixes, or would you prefer to address the placeholder content issue first before proceeding?
