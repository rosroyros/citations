## Issue Context
### Beads Issue ID: citations-2p14

**Frontend foundation for gated results state management**

**Previous Context:**
We have a working glassmorphism implementation (224px height, 400px width) within a 280px height × 1036px width validation table. We want to create 3 landscape-oriented variants that utilize more horizontal space.

## The Question/Problem/Dilemma

User wants to focus on: Generate 3 landscape-oriented glassmorphism variants

**Clarification responses needed:**

**Question 1**: For the landscape orientation, should the content be:
- A) Spread across the full width (1036px) with elements arranged horizontally
- B) Take up more width but still centered (maybe 600-700px instead of 400px)
- C) Asymmetric layout with more visual interest using the horizontal space

**Question 2**: How do you feel about including some of the blurred table content as part of the landscape design? For example:
- A) Keep table completely blurred in background
- B) Show subtle glimpses of table data through the glassmorphism
- C) Create a split view with some table visible alongside the gated content

**Question 3**: Which layout direction feels right for the horizontal arrangement?
- A) Icon → Title/Summary → Button (left to right flow)
- B) Icon/Title centered → Summary/Button on the right
- C) More creative approach with overlapping elements and diagonal flow

**My preference leaning:**
- **B** for width (600-700px centered) - maintains focus but uses more space
- **A** for background (completely blurred) - preserves the "gated" concept
- **A** for layout (left to right flow) - intuitive reading pattern

But I'd love to hear your thoughts on these design decisions before creating the 3 variants!
