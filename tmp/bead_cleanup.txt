Context: The /success page was used as the landing page after redirect-based checkout. With embedded checkout, success is handled in-place (modal shows success state). The /success page is no longer needed and adds code/route maintenance burden.

Decision Made: Delete entirely (not soft-deprecate). Rationale from brainstorm:
- We don't send emails with links to /success
- No need to maintain legacy routes
- Simpler codebase

Files to Delete:
1. frontend/frontend/src/pages/Success.jsx - The full success page component (655 lines)
2. frontend/frontend/src/pages/Success.test.jsx - Associated tests
3. frontend/frontend/src/pages/Success.css - Styles (if exists)

Files to Modify:
1. frontend/frontend/src/App.jsx - Remove:
   - Import: import Success from './pages/Success'
   - Route: if (pathname === '/success') { return <CreditProvider><Success /></CreditProvider> }

Why Delete vs Redirect:
External reviewer suggested soft-deprecation (redirect to homepage). User rejected this because:
- No emails with /success links
- Simpler to delete than maintain redirect logic
- Accept that bookmarks will 404 (acceptable tradeoff)

Dependencies:
- Should be done AFTER all component updates are complete
- Blocked by: n8t4 (UpgradeModal), ysv0 (PricingTables), mcyw (PartialResults)

Verification:
- grep -r "Success" frontend/frontend/src to find remaining references
- Run build to verify no broken imports
