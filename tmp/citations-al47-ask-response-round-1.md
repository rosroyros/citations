**Immediate Actions:**
1. **✅ Continue current approach** - it's working well
2. **Add diversity to test set** - include more "other" and webpage citations
3. **Test with longer citations** - 45.5% hit your length limits

**Future Enhancements:**
4. **Extend analysis window** - consider 60-90 days for seasonal patterns
5. **Weekly sampling** - track citation patterns over time
6. **Success tracking** - modify backend to log validation outcomes

### **Final Assessment:**

**Your approach is solid** and provides excellent insights into real user behavior. The 1,026 citation sample is more than adequate for understanding how your citation validation system performs in production. The main takeaway is that **real user citations are much more diverse than typical test sets** - particularly the high percentage of "other" types and webpages.

**Success criteria met:** ✅ Collected 1,026 citations (far exceeding target of 100) ✅ Identified key differences from test set ✅ Provided actionable insights for test set improvement
