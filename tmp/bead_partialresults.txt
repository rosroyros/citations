Context: PartialResults.jsx shows locked/partial results for free tier users who hit limits. For A/B test variants 1.2 and 2.2, pricing is shown INLINE (not in a modal). When inline checkout succeeds, we need to show a success banner and refresh the UI.

Current State:
- PartialResults renders PricingTableCredits or PricingTablePasses inline for variants 1.2/2.2
- Uses onCheckout prop to pass to pricing components
- After purchase, user was redirected to /success page

New Behavior:
- Checkout happens in embedded iframe (no redirect)
- On success: show inline success banner, refresh credits
- Optionally re-trigger validation to show full results

Changes Required:
1. Add inlineCheckoutSuccess state
2. Pass onCheckoutSuccess callback to PricingTable components
3. On success:
   - Set inlineCheckoutSuccess = true
   - Call refreshCredits() from CreditContext
   - Show success banner above or replacing pricing table
4. Success banner should:
   - Show "Payment Successful! Your credits are now active"
   - Optionally show "Check your citations again" button to re-validate

Important Consideration:
For inline variants, after purchase user is still looking at partial/locked results. We may want to:
A) Show success banner only (simple)
B) Auto-resubmit their citations to show full results (complex)

Recommendation: Start with (A), iterate based on user feedback.

Dependencies:
- Requires: checkoutFlow.js refactor (citations-oaed)
- Parallel with: UpgradeModal and PricingTable updates

Files: frontend/frontend/src/components/PartialResults.jsx

Testing: Add E2E test for inline checkout success flow
