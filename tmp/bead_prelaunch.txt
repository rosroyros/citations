Context: Before launching embedded checkout to production, there are several verification and external coordination tasks.

Pre-Launch Checklist:

1. Email Polar (hello@polar.sh) to enable Apple Pay/Google Pay for our domain
   - Send: Request to add citationformatchecker.com to wallet payments allowlist
   - Why: Wallet payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay) require domain allowlisting
   - When: Do this early, may take 1-2 business days to process

2. Deploy to staging
   - Deploy all changes to staging environment
   - Verify build succeeds

3. Manual integration test with Polar sandbox + ngrok
   - Start ngrok: ngrok http 5173
   - Set FRONTEND_URL to ngrok URL in backend
   - Test full checkout flow with sandbox card
   - Verify: iframe opens, success state shows, credits refresh

4. Deploy to production
   - Deploy via normal deploy_prod.sh workflow
   - Run E2E tests

5. Monitor checkout_error events for first week
   - Watch dashboard for checkout_error analytics events
   - If error rate > 1%, investigate whether fallback is needed
   - This validates our "no fallback" decision

Dependencies:
- Blocked by: All component updates, cleanup, and tests complete

Verification:
- Production flow works end-to-end
- Analytics events firing correctly
- No unusual error rates
