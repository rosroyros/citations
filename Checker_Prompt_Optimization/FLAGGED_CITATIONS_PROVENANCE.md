*[roy: the change to the valid original citation consists of simply replacing "International Organization” with "I. O.” - I think it should indeed be valid and there’s an error in ground truth. However, another approach could be the one stated by our checker: "Problem: Incorrect/abbreviated corporate author Correction: International Organization for Standardization.""]*
