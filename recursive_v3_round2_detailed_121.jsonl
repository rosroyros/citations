T. 1991 The nomological validity of the Type A personality among employed adults _Journal of Applied Psychology_ 76 1 143\u2013168\n\n### Errors Identified:\n1. **Author Formatting**: The use of \"&\" instead of \"and\" in the author list.\n2. **Year Formatting**: The year should be in parentheses.\n3. **Title Formatting**: The title should be in sentence case and italicized.\n4. **Journal Title Formatting**: The journal title should be italicized and in title case.\n5. **Volume and Issue Formatting**: The volume number should be italicized, and the issue number should be in parentheses.\n6. **Page Range Formatting**: The page range should be preceded by \"pp.\" if applicable.\n\n### Analysis of Each Error:\n1. **Author Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the correct format is \"and\" for multiple authors.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n2. **Year Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the year must be in parentheses.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n3. **Title Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the title must be in sentence case and italicized.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n4. **Journal Title Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the journal title must be italicized and in title case.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n5. **Volume and Issue Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Required rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, the volume must be italicized, and the issue number should be in parentheses.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: Yes, this makes the citation invalid.\n\n6. **Page Range Formatting**:\n   - **Required Rule or Preferred Guideline**: Preferred guideline.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: \"pp.\" is not required for journal articles.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: No, this does not make the citation invalid.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**INVALID**\n\n### Reasoning:\nAfter careful reconsideration, the citation remains invalid due to multiple required formatting errors, including the incorrect use of \"&\" instead of \"and,\" the absence of parentheses around the year, and the incorrect formatting of the title and journal name. These are all essential components of APA 7 citation style that must be adhered to for the citation to be considered valid. The only aspect that does not affect validity is the page range formatting, which is a preferred guideline rather than a strict requirement."}

Hans Reitzel Forlag.\n\n### Errors Identified:\n\n1. **Use of Ampersand (&) in Author List:**\n   - **Assessment:** The citation uses an ampersand before the last author, which is correct in APA style. However, there is an extra ampersand before the last author.\n   - **1. Required or Preferred?** Required rule.\n   - **2. Acceptable Variation?** No, the correct format is to use the ampersand only before the last author.\n   - **3. Should this make the citation INVALID?** Yes, this error makes the citation invalid.\n\n2. **Title Formatting:**\n   - **Assessment:** The title is in italics, which is correct. However, the title should be in sentence case, meaning only the first word and proper nouns should be capitalized.\n   - **1. Required or Preferred?** Required rule.\n   - **2. Acceptable Variation?** No, the title must follow the sentence case rule.\n   - **3. Should this make the citation INVALID?** Yes, this error makes the citation invalid.\n\n3. **Edition Information:**\n   - **Assessment:** The edition is noted as \"3rd digital ed.\" which is acceptable, but it should be formatted as \"3rd ed.\" without \"digital\" unless it is specifically relevant to the citation.\n   - **1. Required or Preferred?** Preferred guideline.\n   - **2. Acceptable Variation?** Yes, it could be acceptable if \"digital\" is relevant.\n   - **3. Should this make the citation INVALID?** No, this does not make the citation invalid.\n\n4. **Publisher Name:**\n   - **Assessment:** The publisher name \"Hans Reitzel Forlag\" is correctly formatted.\n   - **1. Required or Preferred?** Required rule.\n   - **2. Acceptable Variation?** Yes, as long as the publisher is accurately represented.\n   - **3. Should this make the citation INVALID?** No, this does not make the citation invalid.\n\n### FINAL DECISION: INVALID\n\n**REASONING:** \nAfter reconsidering the errors, the citation remains invalid due to the following reasons:\n- The incorrect use of the ampersand before the last author is a required rule violation.\n- The title formatting does not adhere to the sentence case requirement, which is also a required rule.\n\nWhile the edition information and publisher name are acceptable, the two critical errors regarding author formatting and title case lead to the conclusion that the citation is invalid."}

APA does not require the inclusion of retraction notes in the citation.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?**: While it is not standard practice to include retraction notes in the citation, it can be acceptable if the context requires it (e.g., if the citation is being used in a discussion about the validity of the work).\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?**: No, the inclusion of the retraction note does not invalidate the citation; it may simply be considered non-standard.\n\n2. **Formatting of DOI**\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?**: The DOI format is a preferred guideline. Both \"doi:10.xxx\" and \"https://doi.org/10.xxx\" are acceptable.\n   - **Could this be an acceptable variation in APA 7?**: Yes, the DOI is correctly formatted as a URL, which is preferred in APA 7.\n   - **Should this really make the citation INVALID?**: No, the DOI is correctly formatted.\n\n3. **Italicization of Journal Title and Volume**\n   - **Is this a REQUIRED rule or PREFERRED guideline?**: This is a required rule.

The DOI is correctly formatted, and while there may be formatting issues with italicization, these do not fundamentally affect the citation's validity. Therefore, I confirm the citation as valid, with the understanding that it could be improved for strict adherence to APA formatting guidelines."}

The title should be in title case, and since this is not followed, it makes the citation invalid. Other elements of the citation are correctly formatted or fall under acceptable variations, but the failure to adhere to the required formatting for the journal title is significant enough to confirm the citation as INVALID."}

However, the original code was published in 2002, and the citation includes amendments.\n   - **Rule Type**: This is a PREFERRED guideline.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: Yes, it is acceptable to cite the most recent year of publication for a document that has been amended.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: This does not make the citation INVALID.\n\n3. **Title Formatting**\n   - **Assessment**: The title is italicized and follows the correct capitalization rules for APA style.\n   - **Rule Type**: This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No variations are needed here; the formatting is correct.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: This does not make the citation INVALID.\n\n4. **Additional Information in Parentheses**\n   - **Assessment**: The additional information about the original publication and amendments is included in parentheses. This is not standard practice in APA 7, where such details are typically not included in the reference list.\n   - **Rule Type**: This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: No, this is not a standard practice in APA 7.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: This could make the citation INVALID due to the inclusion of unnecessary details.\n\n5. **URL Formatting**\n   - **Assessment**: The URL is provided correctly and does not have any punctuation before it.\n   - **Rule Type**: This is a REQUIRED rule.\n   - **Acceptable Variation**: Yes, the URL format is acceptable.\n   - **Impact on Validity**: This does not make the citation INVALID.\n\n### FINAL DECISION: INVALID\n\n**REASONING**: Upon reconsideration, the citation is deemed INVALID primarily due to the inclusion of excessive details in parentheses regarding the original publication and amendments. While the other elements of the citation are correct and follow APA 7 guidelines, the unnecessary information detracts from the citation's validity. In APA style, it is important to keep citations concise and relevant, and the additional details about amendments do not align with standard citation practices. Therefore, the citation should be revised to remove the parenthetical information about the amendments and original publication year."}

Therefore, the citation meets the necessary criteria for APA 7 style, and I confirm that the citation is valid."}
