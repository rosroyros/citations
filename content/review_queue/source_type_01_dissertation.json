The American Psychological Association (APA) citation style provides specific rules for formatting citations, including those for dissertations. This guide will outline the essential rules for citing dissertations in APA 7th edition, including author formatting, title presentation, and the inclusion of URLs. \n\n### Author Formatting\n\n#### Single Author\n\nIn APA 7th edition, when citing a dissertation authored by a single individual, the author's last name is presented first, followed by a comma and the initials of their first and middle names. The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. \n\n**Example:**\n\nSmith, J. A. (2021). The effects of climate change on urban ecosystems. University of California.\n\n#### Two Authors\n\nFor works with two authors, both authors' names are also inverted. They are separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word \"and.\" The format remains consistent, using the last name followed by initials for both authors. \n\n**Example:**\n\nDoe, J. B., & Brown, L. M. (2022). The role of technology in education: A review of recent trends. Harvard University.\n\n### Three or More Authors\n\nWhen citing dissertations with three or more authors, the formatting remains consistent with the two-author rule. You will still need to use an ampersand to separate the last two authors. \n\n**Example:**\n\nTaylor, R. S., Johnson, T. A., & Lee, K. P. (2020). Understanding social dynamics in urban settings. Stanford University.\n\n### 21 or More Authors\n\nIf a dissertation has 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), and then include the final author's name. This rule prevents excessively long citations while still providing key attribution information. \n\n**Example:**\n\nParker, E. F., Jones, A. B., Smith, C. D., Miller, D. E., Anderson, F. G., Wilson, H. J., ... Thompson, R. Z. (2023). Advances in renewable energy technologies. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n### Including Author Titles and Suffixes\n\nWhen listing authors, it is important to note that suffixes such as Jr., Sr., II, and III should be included in the reference list. These suffixes follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic titles like Ph.D. or M.D. should be omitted unless there are special circumstances justifying their inclusion. \n\n**Example:**\n\nJackson, R. P., Jr. (2019). The influence of family dynamics on adolescent behavior. University of Florida.\n\n### Dissertation Titles and Capitalization\n\nDissertation titles should be presented in italics and use sentence case, meaning that only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized. This rule applies to the entire title. \n\n**Example:**\n\nGarcia, N. R. (2021). Exploring the intersection of culture and identity in bilingual education. University of Texas at Austin.\n\n### Including URLs for Online Dissertations\n\nWhen citing a dissertation that is available online, include the URL as a live hyperlink. Do not precede the URL with \"Retrieved from\" and ensure that it is presented in its simplest form, beginning with http:// or https://. Avoid placing a period at the end of a URL unless it is part of the original URL, as this can create confusion. \n\n**Example:**\n\nSmith, J. A. (2021). The effects of climate change on urban ecosystems. University of California. https://www.exampleurl.com/dissertation123\n\n### Practical Tips for Citation\n\n1. **Double-check Name Formatting**: Ensure that you consistently apply the rules for author names, especially with respect to the use of initials and suffixes.\n2. **Pay Attention to Titles**: Remember to italicize dissertation titles and use sentence case.\n3. **Review URL Formatting**: Always verify that URLs are functioning links and formatted correctly without additional punctuation.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n- **Inconsistent Author Listing**: Make sure to maintain the correct order and format when listing multiple authors to avoid confusion.\n- **Ignoring Capitalization Rules**: Improper capitalization in titles can lead to inaccuracies in citations, so pay close attention to formatting.\n- **Incorrect URL Presentation**: Failing to format URLs correctly can make online resources inaccessible to readers, undermining the citation's integrity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCiting dissertations in APA format requires attention to detail and consistency. By following the outlined rules for author formatting, title presentation, and URL inclusion, you can ensure that your citations are accurate and professional. Understanding these guidelines will not only enhance the quality of your work but also contribute to the academic community by providing clear paths for others to follow your research. Proper citation helps maintain scholarly integrity and allows for the continued exploration of ideas within the academic field.\n\n---\n\n## Reference List Examples\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<div class=\"example-variation\">The impact of social media on adolescent mental health: A longitudinal study</div>\n<div class=\"citation-example\">\nChen, L., & Williams, K.

Access to your dissertation or the source you want to cite.\n2. A notepad or digital document for taking notes.\n3. A reliable internet connection for accessing citation tools or additional resources.\n4. APA 7th edition style guide for reference.\n5. A citation management tool (optional) to help organize your references.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating Dissertation Citations\n\n### 1. **Identify the Author(s) of the Dissertation**  \n   **Action:** Locate the author's name on the title page of the dissertation.  \n   **Verification:** Ensure you can clearly see the author's full name.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 1-2 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** If you are using a digital source, you can often find the author's name in the document properties or metadata.\n\n### 2. **Format the Author\u2019s Name**  \n   **Action:** For a single author, write the last name followed by a comma and the first and middle initials, using periods but no spaces between initials. Example: Smith, J.A.  \n   **Verification:** Check that you have inverted the name correctly.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Use a template or format example to ensure consistency with the author\u2019s name.\n\n### 3. **Handle Two Authors**  \n   **Action:** If the dissertation has two authors, format both names using the same method as in Step 2. Use an ampersand (&) between the names, preceded by a comma. Example: Smith, J.A., & Johnson, M.B.  \n   **Verification:** Confirm that both names are inverted and properly connected by an ampersand.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Keep a reference list template handy to quickly format multiple authors.\n\n### 4. **Address Multiple Authors (21 or More)**  \n   **Action:** For dissertations with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, then insert an ellipsis (...) and finally include the last author\u2019s name. Example: Smith, J.A., Johnson, M.B., ... Taylor, R.C.  \n   **Verification:** Double-check that you have listed the correct number of authors and used the ellipsis properly.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Use citation management software to help keep track of multiple authors.\n\n### 5. **Include Titles and Suffixes**  \n   **Action:** If the author has a title or suffix (like Jr., Sr., II, or III), include it after the initials, separated by a comma. Example: Smith, J.A., Jr.  \n   **Verification:** Review the author's full name to ensure all elements are included correctly.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 2 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Make a note of suffixes as you gather information about the author to avoid missing them later.\n\n### 6. **Add the Dissertation Title**  \n   **Action:** Write the title of the dissertation in italics and in sentence case (only the first word and proper nouns capitalized). Example: The effects of social media on student engagement.  \n   **Verification:** Check that the title is in the correct format and italicized.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Use the dissertation's title page as a reference to avoid misformatting.\n\n### 7. **Provide the Source Information**  \n   **Action:** Include the name of the institution and the year of publication in parentheses. Example: (University of Example, 2021).  \n   **Verification:** Confirm that the institution's name and publication year are accurate.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 2 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Keep a list of institutions and their corresponding publication years to streamline the process.\n\n### 8. **Insert the URL**  \n   **Action:** If the dissertation is available online, include the URL as a live hyperlink, starting with http:// or https://. Example: https://www.exampleuniversity.edu/dissertation.  \n   **Verification:** Ensure that the URL works and does not include any extra punctuation at the end.  \n   **Time Estimate:** 2 minutes.  \n   **Tip for Efficiency:** Copy the URL directly from your browser to avoid typos.\n\n### Final Check  \nAfter completing the above steps, review your citation for accuracy and adherence to APA formatting guidelines. This final check is crucial to ensure your citation is correctly formatted. \n\n### Total Time Estimate  \nCompleting all steps should take approximately 20-30 minutes, but this may vary based on familiarity with the citation process and the complexity of the dissertation. \n\nBy following these detailed\n\n---\n\n## Common Errors for Dissertation Citation Citations\n\n<div class=\"error-example\">\n<strong>\u274c Article Title Title Case Error</strong>\n<div style=\"font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;

The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. This format applies to all reference types including journal articles, books, and webpages. The author's name should be inverted (last name first) in the reference list only. This rule ensures consistency across all citation formats and makes alphabetical ordering more efficient in reference lists.</li>\n<li>For works with two authors, both names should be inverted (last name first) and separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word 'and'. Each author's name follows the single author format (Last name, initials). The ampersand should be preceded by a comma. This format is used in both reference lists and parenthetical citations, but narrative citations use 'and' instead of '&'. This rule distinguishes APA from other citation styles and maintains consistency across multi-author works.</li>\n<li>For works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. All listed authors follow the standard inverted format. This rule prevents extremely long citation lists while still providing key attribution information. The ellipsis should not be italicized or bracketed. This change from APA 6th edition's 7+ author rule provides more comprehensive author listing.</li>\n<li>Author titles, suffixes, and credentials (like Jr., Sr., II, III, Ph.D., M.D.) should be included in the reference list. Suffixes like Jr., Sr., II, and III follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic and professional credentials are generally omitted from reference list entries but may be included in special circumstances. Titles like Dr., Professor, or military ranks are not included in reference list citations. This rule provides complete identification when needed while avoiding unnecessary credential inflation.</li>\n<li>When including URLs for websites, online documents, or other sources without DOIs, present them as live hyperlinks without any special formatting or punctuation. APA 7 removes the 'Retrieved from' prefix that was required in APA 6 for most URLs. URLs should be presented in their simplest form, beginning with http:// or https://, and should be hyperlinks in digital documents. Do not add a period at the end of a URL unless it is part of the original URL. This simplification makes citations cleaner while maintaining functionality for digital access to sources.</li>\n<li>When a URL or DOI leads to a broken or inactive link, APA 7 provides several options for handling the citation. If the source is available through an archive like the Internet Archive, include the archived URL. If the source cannot be located, include as much information as possible and note that the resource is no longer available. For journal articles with broken DOIs, include the DOI but add a note indicating it's inactive. The principle is to provide enough information for readers to locate the source if possible, while acknowledging access limitations. This represents more detailed guidance than APA 6 provided for handling broken links.</li>\n<li>For sources from academic databases, APA 7 simplifies formatting by generally omitting database names and URLs. Most scholarly articles found in databases should be cited using their DOI rather than the database URL. Only include database information when the source is exclusive to that database and cannot be found elsewhere, such as with dissertations or some reports. This represents a major change from APA 6, where database names and retrieval information were commonly included. The principle is to provide the most direct and permanent path to the source, which is typically through the DOI rather than database-specific access information.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Special Cases\n\n## Understanding Special and Edge Cases in APA Dissertation Citations\n\nCiting dissertations in APA style can sometimes present unique challenges. This guide will explore special cases and edge cases regarding dissertation citations according to the APA 7th edition. By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure clarity and consistency in your academic writing.\n\n### General Format for Dissertations\n\nIn APA style, the basic format for citing a dissertation includes the author's name, the year of publication, the title of the dissertation in italics, the type of dissertation, and the institution. A standard citation looks like this:\n\n**Author, A. A. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation, Name of Institution). Database or archive name.**\n\n### Special Cases in Dissertation Citations\n\n#### 1. Multiple Authors\n\nWhen citing dissertations with multiple authors, the rules for author formatting still apply. For dissertations with two authors, you will format the citation as follows:\n\n**Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation, Name of Institution). Database or archive name.**\n\n**Example:**\n\nSmith, J. A., & Doe, R. B. (2020). Strategies for improving student engagement (Doctoral dissertation, University of Education). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global.\n\nFor dissertations with three or more authors, follow the same rule as with other works. List the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author.\n\n**Example:**\n\nBrown, L. M., White, E. P., Green, R. S., Black, T. A., Gray, J. K., Blue, C. D., ... Red, F. G. (2021). Impact of social media on academic performance (Doctoral dissertation, University of Social Sciences). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global.\n\n#### 2. Including Suffixes\n\nWhen an author has a suffix, such as Jr. or III, include it in the reference list. The suffix follows the initials and is separated by a comma.\n\n**Example:**\n\nJohnson, A. B., Jr. (2019). Innovative approaches to modern education (Doctoral dissertation, University of Learning). Academic Archive.\n\n### Edge Cases in Dissertation Citations\n\n#### 1. No DOI or URL Available\n\nIf the dissertation does not have a DOI or a URL available, simply omit this part from the citation. Ensure that the citation still contains all the necessary elements.\n\n**Example:**\n\nWilliams, C. D. (2018). Exploring the depths of environmental science (Doctoral dissertation, University of Nature).\n\n#### 2. Dissertations Published in a Different Language\n\nIf the dissertation is published in a language other than English, include the title in the original language, followed by a translation in brackets. This practice acknowledges the work's origin while providing clarity for English-speaking audiences.\n\n**Example:**\n\nGarcia, M. L. (2017). La influencia del arte en la educaci\u00f3n (Doctoral dissertation, Universidad de Arte). [The influence of art on education].\n\n### Why These Rules Matter\n\nProper citation is crucial in academic writing for several reasons. It gives credit to original authors, allows readers to locate the source, and contributes to the credibility of your work. By following the APA guidelines, you maintain a scholarly tone and demonstrate attention to detail.\n\n### Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Double-check Author Order**: Ensure that authors are listed in the correct order, as this can affect credit and acknowledgment.\n  \n2. **Stay Consistent**: Follow the same formatting rules throughout your document. Inconsistencies can confuse readers and detract from your work's professionalism.\n\n3. **Use Reliable Sources**: Always reference reputable databases or archives when citing dissertations. This enhances the credibility of your citations.\n\n4. **Be Cautious with Ellipses**: When using ellipses to condense author names, ensure that you do not omit key contributors to the work.\n\n5. **Keep URLs Simple**: When adding URLs, ensure they are concise and functional. Avoid any additional punctuation that could hinder access.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCiting dissertations in APA style requires attention to detail, especially in special and edge cases. By understanding the nuances of author formatting, suffix inclusion, and language considerations, you can create accurate and effective citations. Following these guidelines helps uphold the integrity of academic work and allows others to engage with your sources easily. Always remember that clarity and consistency are key to successful citations.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How do I cite a dissertation in APA format?\n\nTo cite a dissertation in APA format, you need to include the author's last name, first initial, year of publication, title of the dissertation in italics, the type of dissertation, and the institution that awarded the degree. For example, the citation would look like this: Last Name, F. M. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation). University Name. Make sure to follow the specific guidelines for capitalization of the title and to include a DOI if available. For more detailed information, you can refer to the APA Publication Manual or visit the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### What if the dissertation I want to cite is unpublished?\n\nIf you want to cite an unpublished dissertation, the format is slightly different. You still include the author's last name, first initial, year, title in italics, and specify that it is an unpublished dissertation. For example: Last Name, F. M. (Year). Title of dissertation (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University Name. Note that unpublished dissertations may not have a DOI. If you are unsure about the status of the dissertation, it's best to check the institution's library or repository. For further guidance, please see the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### How do I format multiple authors for a dissertation citation?\n\nWhen citing a dissertation with multiple authors in APA format, you list all authors in the same order they appear on the dissertation. For up to 20 authors, include each author's last name followed by their initials, separated by commas. Use an ampersand (&) before the last author's name. For example: Last Name, F. M., Last Name, A. B., & Last Name, C. D. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation). University Name. If there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19, followed by an ellipsis (...) and then the last author's name. For additional information, check the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### Do I need to include a retrieval date for online dissertations?\n\nIn APA format, you generally do not need to include a retrieval date for online dissertations unless the content is likely to change over time. This is usually applicable for websites that update their content frequently. If you are citing an online dissertation that is stable and has a DOI, you would format it as: Last Name, F. M. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation). University Name. DOI. If the dissertation is not stable, you may include the retrieval date. For more detailed guidelines, refer to the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### How do I cite a dissertation that I accessed through a database?\n\nWhen citing a dissertation accessed through a database in APA format, include the author's last name, first initial, year of publication, title in italics, the type of dissertation, the institution, and the database name. For example: Last Name, F. M. (Year). Title of dissertation (Doctoral dissertation). University Name. Database Name. If the dissertation has a DOI, include it at the end of the citation. If you accessed it from a specific database like ProQuest, you can specify that in the citation. For further details, consult the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### What is the difference between a master's thesis and a doctoral dissertation in citation?\n\nIn APA format, the main difference when citing a master's thesis versus a doctoral dissertation lies in the designation of the type of work. For a master's thesis, you would specify it as 'master's thesis' in the citation. For example: Last Name, F. M. (Year). Title of thesis (Master's thesis). University Name. For a doctoral dissertation, you would use 'Doctoral dissertation.' Both formats require similar information, but it is crucial to indicate the type correctly. For more insights, you can refer to the APA Style website for examples and guidelines.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25\n**Reading Time:** 10 minutes\n\n---\n\n<div class=\"cta-placement\">\n    <h3>Need to Check Your Citations?</h3>\n    <p>Use our free APA citation checker to validate your dissertation citation citations instantly.</p>\n    <a href=\"/checker/\" class=\"cta-button\">Check Citations Now</a>\n</div>",
