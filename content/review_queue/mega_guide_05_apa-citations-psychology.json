This guide provides an overview of APA citation rules, focusing on author formatting, which is crucial for ensuring correct attribution of works in your reference list and in-text citations. Following these guidelines will enhance the clarity and professionalism of your academic writing.\n\n### Author Formatting Rules\n\n#### Single Author Format\n\nIn the APA 7th edition, a single author's name should be formatted with the last name first, followed by a comma and the first initial, with a period after it. If a middle initial is included, it should also follow the same format, being separated by a period and without spaces.\n\n**Correct Examples:**\n- Johnson, M. K.\n- Williams, R. A.\n\n**Incorrect Examples:**\n- M. K. Johnson (name not inverted)\n- Johnson, M.K. (missing space after the period)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThis format ensures consistency and helps in the alphabetical ordering of references, making it easier for readers to locate sources.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Not inverting the name\n- Omitting the comma after the last name\n- Adding spaces between initials\n\n#### Two Authors Format\n\nFor works with two authors, both names should also be inverted and separated by an ampersand (&). The ampersand must be preceded by a comma. This formatting rule applies to reference lists and parenthetical citations. However, in narrative citations, use \"and\" instead of \"&\".\n\n**Correct Examples:**\n- Smith, J. D., & Brown, A. M.\n- Garcia, L. P., & Martinez, R. T.\n\n**Incorrect Examples:**\n- Smith, J. D. and Brown, A. M. (using 'and' instead of '&')\n- J. D. Smith & A. M. Brown (incorrect format)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nUsing the correct format not only maintains consistency but also adheres to the APA style, distinguishing it from other citation formats.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Using 'and' instead of '&'\n- Forgetting to invert the second author's name\n- Missing the comma before the ampersand\n\n#### Three to Twenty Authors\n\nWhen citing works with three to twenty authors, list all authors in the reference list. Each author's name should be inverted, separated by commas, with an ampersand before the final author.\n\n**Correct Examples:**\n- Anderson, K. L., Williams, J. M., Davis, S. R., & Thompson, B. P.\n- Chen, X., Rodriguez, M., Johnson, L., Kim, S., & Patel, R.\n\n**Incorrect Examples:**\n- Anderson, K. L., et al. (using 'et al.' prematurely)\n- Anderson, K. L., Williams, J. M., Davis, S. R. and Thompson, B. P. (using 'and' instead of '&')\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThis rule ensures that all authors receive proper credit, which is particularly important in academic settings.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Using 'et al.' too soon\n- Forgetting to list all authors\n- Incorrectly using 'and' instead of '&'\n\n#### Twenty or More Authors\n\nFor works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), and then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. \n\n**Correct Examples:**\n- Author1, A. A., Author2, B. B., Author3, C. C., Author4, D. D., Author5, E. E., Author6, F. F., Author7, G. G., Author8, H. H., Author9, I. I., Author10, J. J., Author11, K. K., Author12, L. L., Author13, M. M., Author14, N. N., Author15, O. O., Author16, P. P., Author17, Q. Q., Author18, R. R., Author19, S. S., ... LastAuthor, Z. Z.\n- Johnson, M. K., Williams, R. A., Brown, L. D., Davis, S. M., ... Smith, T. R.\n\n**Incorrect Examples:**\n- Author1, A. A., et al. (incorrect format)\n- Author1, A. A., Author2, B. B., ... Author20, T. T., LastAuthor, Z. Z. (incorrect ordering)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThis format prevents excessively long author lists while still providing necessary attribution.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Using 'et al.' instead of the ellipsis\n- Listing too many authors\n- Omitting the final author\n\n### Organization as Author\n\nWhen an organization, corporation, or government agency is the author, use the full official name without inversion. Only use abbreviations if the organization is commonly known by them.\n\n**Correct Examples:**\n- American Psychological Association\n- National Institute of Mental Health\n\n**Incorrect Examples:**\n- APA (using abbreviation instead of full name)\n- Association, American Psychological (incorrect naming order)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThis ensures that the work is attributed correctly, providing clarity to the reader about the source.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Using an abbreviation instead of the full name\n- Inverting organizational names\n- Omitting explanations for acronyms\n\n### Handling Anonymous Works\n\nWhen no author is listed, move the title to the author position, followed by the date. Do not use \"Anonymous\" unless the work is actually signed that way.\n\n**Correct Examples:**\n- Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary. (2003).\n- Anonymous. (2018). The art of invisibility.\n\n**Incorrect Examples:**\n- Unknown author. (2018). The art of invisibility. (incorrect phrasing)\n- Anonymous. (2003). Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary. (incorrect ordering)\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThis rule allows readers to identify works by their titles when authorship is unknown, maintaining the standard reference format structure.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Using \"Anonymous\" incorrectly\n- Leaving the author position empty\n- Not properly moving the title to the author position\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAdhering to APA citation rules is essential for anyone writing in the field of psychology. Proper author formatting not only ensures clarity and consistency but also provides proper attribution to the authors of the works you reference. By following these guidelines, you can avoid common pitfalls and enhance the credibility of your academic writing. Remember to always double-check your citations against the APA manual for the most accurate formatting.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Comprehensive Examples\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<div class=\"example-variation\">The impact of social media on adolescent mental health: A longitudinal study</div>\n<div class=\"citation-example\">\nChen, L., & Williams, K.

single authors are formatted with last name followed by a comma and first and middle initials. The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. This format applies to all reference types including journal articles, books, and webpages. The author's name should be inverted (last name first) in the reference list only. This rule ensures consistency across all citation formats and makes alphabetical ordering more efficient in reference lists.</li>\n<li>For works with two authors, both names should be inverted (last name first) and separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word 'and'. Each author's name follows the single author format (Last name, initials). The ampersand should be preceded by a comma. This format is used in both reference lists and parenthetical citations, but narrative citations use 'and' instead of '&'. This rule distinguishes APA from other citation styles and maintains consistency across multi-author works.</li>\n<li>For works with three to twenty authors, list all authors in the reference list. Each author's name should be inverted (last name first) with initials. Authors should be separated by commas, with an ampersand (&) before the final author's name. This represents a significant change from APA 6th edition, which used 'et al.' for works with seven or more authors. This rule ensures proper attribution to all contributors while maintaining readability for moderately sized author groups.</li>\n<li>For works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. All listed authors follow the standard inverted format. This rule prevents extremely long citation lists while still providing key attribution information. The ellipsis should not be italicized or bracketed. This change from APA 6th edition's 7+ author rule provides more comprehensive author listing.</li>\n<li>When an organization, corporation, or government agency is the author, use the full official name of the organization. Do not invert organizational names or use initials unless the organization is commonly known by its abbreviation (like APA or NIH). The organization name should be written out completely in the first mention, with abbreviations in brackets if they will be used subsequently. This rule ensures proper attribution for corporate and institutional authors while maintaining clarity for readers.</li>\n<li>Government authors should include the specific agency or department as the author. When parent departments are relevant to identification, they can be included in the publisher position instead of the author position. Use the most specific agency name as the author. For example, use 'National Institute of Mental Health' rather than 'U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Mental Health.' This rule provides clear attribution while avoiding unnecessarily long author names.</li>\n<li>When no author is listed and the work cannot be attributed to a specific organization, move the title to the author position, followed by the date. Do not use 'Anonymous' as the author unless the work is actually signed 'Anonymous.' For works truly signed 'Anonymous,' treat 'Anonymous' as the author name. This rule ensures that readers can identify works by their titles when authorship is unknown while maintaining the standard reference format structure.</li>\n<li>Author titles, suffixes, and credentials (like Jr., Sr., II, III, Ph.D., M.D.) should be included in the reference list. Suffixes like Jr., Sr., II, and III follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic and professional credentials are generally omitted from reference list entries but may be included in special circumstances. Titles like Dr., Professor, or military ranks are not included in reference list citations. This rule provides complete identification when needed while avoiding unnecessary credential inflation.</li>\n<li>When authors share the same surname, include their first initials even when there are multiple authors. This prevents confusion between different authors with identical last names. The standard format remains the same (Last name, initials), but this rule ensures that all authors are properly distinguished. This is particularly important in reference list ordering and when readers need to distinguish between works by different authors with common surnames.</li>\n<li>Authors with double surnames (like Hernandez Lopez or Van der Wiel) should maintain both parts of the surname in the reference list. Treat the double surname as a single unit with a comma after the complete surname. Do not insert commas between parts of compound surnames unless that is the person's preferred usage. This rule respects cultural naming conventions and ensures accurate identification of authors with complex surnames.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n\n## \ud83d\ude4b Frequently Asked Questions\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite a book in APA format?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">To cite a book in APA format, you need to include the author's last name, first initial, the publication year, the title of the book in italics, and the publisher's name. For example, a basic book citation would look like this: Smith, J. (2020). Understanding psychology. Psychology Press. Remember, if the book has a DOI, include it at the end of the citation. If you are citing a specific chapter in an edited book, you would format it slightly differently. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the APA Publication Manual or the Purdue Online Writing Lab.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What is the correct way to cite a journal article in APA style?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">To cite a journal article in APA style, you need to include the author's last name, first initial, the publication year, the title of the article, the journal name in italics, volume number in italics, issue number in parentheses, page range, and the DOI if available. For example: Doe, J. (2021). The effects of sleep on cognitive function. Journal of Psychology, 15(3), 45-56. If the article does not have a DOI, you may omit that part. For more examples and explanations, you can check the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite a website in APA format?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">When citing a website in APA format, include the author's last name, first initial, the publication date in parentheses, the title of the webpage in italics, and the URL. For example: Johnson, L. (2022). The impact of social media on mental health. Retrieved from https://www.example.com. If no author is available, start with the title instead. Remember to check if the webpage has a publication date, and if not, use 'n.d.' to indicate 'no date'. For further details, visit the APA Style Blog.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite multiple authors in APA style?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">When citing a work with multiple authors in APA style, the format changes depending on the number of authors. For one or two authors, list all authors in the order they appear in the source. For three or more authors, list the first author's last name followed by 'et al.' For example, for three authors: Smith, J., Doe, A., & Brown, P. (2021). Study on behavior. Journal of Psychology, 5(2), 100-110 becomes Smith, J., et al. (2021). Study on behavior. If you want to ensure accuracy, consult the APA Publication Manual or the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What is the difference between a reference list and a bibliography?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">In APA style, a reference list includes only the sources that you cited in your paper, while a bibliography may include all sources you consulted, even those not directly cited. The reference list is formatted with a hanging indent and is arranged alphabetically by the last name of the first author. Make sure to double-check your reference list for accuracy and completeness. For more information about creating a reference list, you can refer to the APA Style website or the APA Publication Manual.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How should I format in-text citations in APA style?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">In-text citations in APA style can be formatted in two ways: parenthetical and narrative. For a parenthetical citation, include the author's last name and the publication year in parentheses after the relevant information, such as (Smith, 2020). In a narrative citation, incorporate the author's name into your text followed by the publication year in parentheses, such as Smith (2020) found that... If you are citing a specific page, include the page number as well, for example: (Smith, 2020, p. 23). For more examples, the APA Style website is a helpful resource.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite a secondary source in APA format?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">When citing a secondary source in APA style, you should mention the original author and the secondary source in your text. For example, if you read about Smith's work in Jones's book, you would write something like 'Smith (as cited in Jones, 2021) found that...'. In your reference list, you only include the source you actually consulted, which in this case would be Jones's work. This helps maintain clarity and avoids confusion. For further guidance, check the APA Manual or the APA Style Blog.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite an edited book in APA style?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">To cite an edited book in APA style, list the editor's name followed by '(Ed.)' or '(Eds.)' for multiple editors. Include the publication year, the title of the book in italics, and the publisher's name. For example: Brown, P. (Ed.). (2021). Advances in psychology. Psychology Press. If you are citing a specific chapter from the edited book, you would cite it as you would a normal chapter, including the chapter author's name. For more detailed examples, refer to the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What if my source does not have a publication date?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">If your source does not have a publication date, you should use 'n.d.' to indicate 'no date'. For example, in your citation, you would format it like this: Smith, J. (n.d.). Title of the work. Publisher. This is particularly common for online sources where the publication date is not clearly stated. Make sure to use this format consistently throughout your reference list. For more information, visit the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I handle citations for sources with no author?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">When citing a source with no identifiable author in APA style, you should begin with the title of the work instead. The title should be italicized if it is a standalone work, such as a book or report. For example: Title of the report. (2020). Publisher. If it is an article, use quotation marks around the title and include the source. In your in-text citation, use the title or a shortened version of it along with the year. For more examples and guidance, check the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite a thesis or dissertation in APA format?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">To cite a thesis or dissertation in APA format, include the author's name, the publication year, the title in italics, the descriptor 'Unpublished master's thesis' or 'Unpublished doctoral dissertation', and the name of the institution. For example: Doe, J. (2020). Title of the thesis. Unpublished master's thesis, University of Psychology. If the thesis is available online, include the URL at the end. For more information and examples, refer to the APA Publication Manual or the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Related Resources\n\n- [APA Citation Checker](/checker/)\n- [Common APA Errors](/guides/common-errors/)\n- [APA Style Guide](/guides/apa-style/)\n\n---\n\n## \u2728 Conclusion\n\nThis guide provides you with comprehensive knowledge to master APA 7th edition citation format.
