This section will guide you through the specific formatting rules for newspaper citations, highlighting the importance of each guideline and offering practical examples.\n\n### Author Formatting\n\nThe first step in citing a newspaper article is to format the author\u2019s name correctly. For a single author, the format is as follows:\n\n- Last name, followed by a comma, and then the first initial and middle initial (if available). Each initial should be separated by periods.\n\n**Example:**\nSmith, J. A.\n\n#### Multiple Authors\n\nFor articles with two authors, both names should be inverted and separated by an ampersand (&). The format is:\n\n- Last name, initials of the first author, followed by a comma, then the second author's last name, followed by their initials.\n\n**Example:**\nSmith, J. A., & Doe, R. B.\n\nFor works with three or more authors, the format remains the same for the first two authors, while subsequent authors are listed as follows:\n\n**Example:**\nSmith, J. A., Doe, R. B., & Johnson, L. M.\n\n### Date of Publication\n\nWhen citing newspapers, it is important to include the specific date of publication if it is relevant to the content. The date should be formatted as:\n\n- Year, Month Day.\n\nThe month must be spelled out, and the day should be presented using numerals without ordinal suffixes.\n\n**Example:**\n2023, October 5.\n\n### Title of the Article\n\nThe title of the article should be in sentence case. This means that only the first word of the title, the first word after a colon (if applicable), and any proper nouns should be capitalized.\n\n**Example:**\nThe impact of technology on modern education.\n\n### Newspaper Title\n\nFollowing the article title, include the name of the newspaper in italics. Each major word in the newspaper title should be capitalized.\n\n**Example:**\n*The New York Times*\n\n### Page Numbers\n\nIf the article spans multiple pages, include the page range. If it is a single page, just list that page number.\n\n**Example:**\npp. A1-A3.\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nThe complete reference format for a newspaper article is as follows:\n\n- Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. *Title of the Newspaper*, pp. page numbers.\n\n**Example:**\nSmith, J. A. (2023, October 5). The impact of technology on modern education. *The New York Times*, pp. A1-A3.\n\n### Importance of Proper Citation\n\nFollowing these citation rules is crucial for several reasons. First, proper citation allows readers to locate the original source, ensuring transparency in research. Second, accurate citations enhance the credibility of your work, as they demonstrate your engagement with existing literature. Lastly, adhering to APA style helps maintain consistency across academic writing, making it easier for readers to navigate your references.\n\n### Practical Tips\n\n- **Always double-check author names:** Ensure the correct spelling and order of authors to prevent misattribution.\n- **Use italics correctly:** Remember to italicize the newspaper title, not the article title.\n- **Be mindful of dates:** Always include the full date for newspaper articles, as this information is often critical for locating the source.\n- **Watch for punctuation:** Pay attention to commas and periods, as they are essential for proper formatting.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Neglecting the publication date:** Always include the specific date when citing newspapers, as this is a critical piece of information.\n2. **Incorrect author formatting:** Remember to invert the names as required and use the correct punctuation.\n3. **Forgetting to italicize the newspaper title:** This is a frequent error that can make your citation look unprofessional.\n4. **Using ordinal suffixes for dates:** Avoid adding \"st,\" \"nd,\" \"rd,\" or \"th\" after day numbers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCiting newspaper articles in APA 7th edition follows specific rules that ensure clarity and consistency. By adhering to these guidelines, you not only enhance the credibility of your work but also aid readers in locating the original sources. Whether you are writing a research paper, thesis, or article, understanding how to properly format your citations is essential for effective academic communication.\n\n---\n\n## Reference List Examples\n\n<p>Here are correctly formatted examples for common newspaper citation variations:</p>\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<div class=\"example-variation\">The impact of social media on adolescent mental health: A longitudinal study</div>\n<div class=\"citation-example\">\nChen, L., & Williams, K.

If there are multiple authors, note their names accordingly.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 1-2 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** If there are multiple authors, write down their names in the order they appear in the article. \n\n### 2. **Format the Author's Name**\n\n**Action:** Format the author\u2019s name in the APA style. For a single author, write the last name followed by a comma and their initials. For example, if the author's name is John Doe, you would format it as Doe, J.\n\n**Verification:** Check that you have the last name first, followed by a comma, and then the initials.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 1 minute.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** If there are two authors, remember to format the second author in the same way, separating them with an ampersand. For example, Doe, J., & Smith, A.\n\n### 3. **Determine the Publication Date**\n\n**Action:** Find the publication date of the article. This information is typically located near the title or in the header.\n\n**Verification:** Ensure you have the complete date, including the year, month, and day. For instance, if the article was published on March 15, 2022, you will use this complete date.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 1-2 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** Write down the date in the required format: Year, Month Day (e.g., 2022, March 15).\n\n### 4. **Locate the Title of the Article**\n\n**Action:** Identify and write down the title of the article.

Remember that only the first word of the title and any proper nouns are capitalized in APA format.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 1 minute.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** If the title is long, write down only the first few words and check the full title later.\n\n### 5. **Find the Newspaper Name**\n\n**Action:** Locate the name of the newspaper, which is usually found at the top of the article or in the header.\n\n**Verification:** Ensure the newspaper name is correct and formatted in italics.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 1 minute.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** If you are citing an online article, make sure to check that the newspaper name is accurate as it appears online.\n\n### 6. **Include the URL (if applicable)**\n\n**Action:** If the article is sourced online, copy the URL where the article can be found. This is important for readers to locate the source easily.\n\n**Verification:** Make sure the URL is complete and functional.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 1 minute.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** Use a reliable source to ensure the URL is correct, and avoid using shortened links.\n\n### 7. **Combine All Elements into a Citation**\n\n**Action:** Put together all the elements in the following order: Author(s). (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. *Name of the Newspaper*. URL. \n\nFor example: \nDoe, J. (2022, March 15). Understanding citation formats. *The Example Times*. https://www.example.com/article\n\n**Verification:** Double-check each component for accuracy and formatting according to APA guidelines.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** Use a citation generator tool to help format if you are unsure, but always double-check for accuracy.\n\n### 8. **Review Your Citation**\n\n**Action:** Read through your completed citation to ensure all elements are in the correct order and format. \n\n**Verification:** Confirm that you have followed the APA 7th edition guidelines correctly.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 2 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency:** If possible, compare your citation with examples from a reliable APA style guide or consult with a peer for feedback.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully create a proper APA citation for a newspaper article. Take your time to ensure accuracy, as correct citations are essential for academic integrity.\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Common Errors for Newspaper Citation Citations\n\n<div class=\"error-example\">\n<strong>\u274c Proper Noun Capitalization Error</strong>\n<div style=\"font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;

The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. This format applies to all reference types including journal articles, books, and webpages. The author's name should be inverted (last name first) in the reference list only. This rule ensures consistency across all citation formats and makes alphabetical ordering more efficient in reference lists.</li>\n<li>For works with two authors, both names should be inverted (last name first) and separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word 'and'. Each author's name follows the single author format (Last name, initials). The ampersand should be preceded by a comma. This format is used in both reference lists and parenthetical citations, but narrative citations use 'and' instead of '&'. This rule distinguishes APA from other citation styles and maintains consistency across multi-author works.</li>\n<li>For works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. All listed authors follow the standard inverted format. This rule prevents extremely long citation lists while still providing key attribution information. The ellipsis should not be italicized or bracketed. This change from APA 6th edition's 7+ author rule provides more comprehensive author listing.</li>\n<li>Author titles, suffixes, and credentials (like Jr., Sr., II, III, Ph.D., M.D.) should be included in the reference list. Suffixes like Jr., Sr., II, and III follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic and professional credentials are generally omitted from reference list entries but may be included in special circumstances. Titles like Dr., Professor, or military ranks are not included in reference list citations. This rule provides complete identification when needed while avoiding unnecessary credential inflation.</li>\n<li>For sources that require more specific dating than just the year, use Year, Month Day format. This applies to newspapers, magazines, blog posts, social media posts, and some online sources where the specific date is important for locating the source. The month should be spelled out, followed by the day number without ordinal suffixes. This format replaces the APA 6 practice of including (Year, Month Day) for these source types, simplifying the reference format while maintaining specificity.</li>\n<li>Article titles in APA 7 references should use sentence case, meaning only the first word of the title, the first word of the subtitle (after a colon), and proper nouns are capitalized. This applies to journal articles, magazine articles, and newspaper articles. The rule emphasizes natural language capitalization rather than the more formal title case used for book and journal titles. Subtitles are treated as separate sentences for capitalization purposes.</li>\n<li>Journal and periodical titles use title case in APA 7 references. All major words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are capitalized, while minor words (articles, short prepositions, conjunctions) are lowercase unless they are the first or last word of the title or subtitle. This rule applies to journal names, magazine titles, and newspaper titles in reference list entries.</li>\n<li>When including URLs for websites, online documents, or other sources without DOIs, present them as live hyperlinks without any special formatting or punctuation. APA 7 removes the 'Retrieved from' prefix that was required in APA 6 for most URLs. URLs should be presented in their simplest form, beginning with http:// or https://, and should be hyperlinks in digital documents. Do not add a period at the end of a URL unless it is part of the original URL. This simplification makes citations cleaner while maintaining functionality for digital access to sources.</li>\n<li>When a URL or DOI leads to a broken or inactive link, APA 7 provides several options for handling the citation. If the source is available through an archive like the Internet Archive, include the archived URL. If the source cannot be located, include as much information as possible and note that the resource is no longer available. For journal articles with broken DOIs, include the DOI but add a note indicating it's inactive. The principle is to provide enough information for readers to locate the source if possible, while acknowledging access limitations. This represents more detailed guidance than APA 6 provided for handling broken links.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Special Cases\n\n## Introduction\n\nCiting newspaper articles in APA 7th edition can present special cases and edge cases that require careful attention. This guide aims to clarify these scenarios to help you produce accurate and consistent citations. Understanding these nuances is essential for maintaining academic integrity and ensuring that your readers can trace your sources.\n\n## General Format for Newspaper Articles\n\nBefore diving into the special cases, it is important to understand the general format for citing newspaper articles in APA style. The basic format for a newspaper citation is as follows:\n\n**Format:**\nAuthor, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. *Title of the Newspaper*. URL\n\n### Example:\nSmith, J. A. (2021, May 12). Local park renovations begin this summer. *The Daily News*. https://www.dailynews.com/local-park-renovations\n\n## Special Cases in Newspaper Citations\n\n### Citing Articles with No Author\n\nSometimes, a newspaper article may not have a clear author. In these cases, the title of the article takes the place of the author in the citation.\n\n**Format:**\nTitle of the article. (Year, Month Day). *Title of the Newspaper*. URL\n\n### Example:\nLocal park renovations begin this summer. (2021, May 12). *The Daily News*. https://www.dailynews.com/local-park-renovations\n\n**Explanation:**\nBy placing the article title at the beginning, readers can still identify the source. This rule is essential for maintaining clarity and ensuring that the citation serves its purpose effectively.\n\n### Citing Opinion Pieces or Editorials\n\nOpinion pieces, editorials, and letters to the editor often have a specific author but may be treated differently in terms of citation due to their nature. It is important to cite them as you would any other article.\n\n**Format:**\nAuthor, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. *Title of the Newspaper*. URL\n\n### Example:\nJohnson, L. B. (2021, June 15). Why community engagement matters. *The Global Times*. https://www.globaltimes.com/community-engagement\n\n**Explanation:**\nThese articles provide unique perspectives and should be cited properly to give credit to the authors who expressed their opinions. Accurate citation helps to provide context and strengthens arguments in your own writing.\n\n## Edge Cases in Newspaper Citations\n\n### Citing Articles with Multiple Authors\n\nWhen citing articles with two authors, both names should be inverted and separated by an ampersand (&). \n\n**Format:**\nAuthor, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. *Title of the Newspaper*. URL\n\n### Example:\nSmith, J. A., & Johnson, L. B. (2021, May 12). Local park renovations begin this summer. *The Daily News*. https://www.dailynews.com/local-park-renovations\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis format ensures that both authors receive proper credit. The use of an ampersand in the reference list and a change to 'and' in narrative citations helps maintain clarity.\n\n### Citing Articles with 21 or More Authors\n\nIn cases where an article has 21 or more authors, you only list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name. \n\n**Format:**\nAuthor, A. A., Author, B. B., Author, C. C., Author, D. D., Author, E. E., Author, F. F., Author, G. G., Author, H. H., Author, I. I., Author, J. J., Author, K. K., Author, L. L., Author, M. M., Author, N. N., Author, O. O., Author, P. P., Author, Q. Q., Author, R. R., Author, S. S., Author, T. T., ... Author, Z. Z. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. *Title of the Newspaper*. URL\n\n### Example:\nSmith, J. A., Johnson, L. B., Davis, C. D., Miller, E. F., Lee, G. H., Wilson, I. J., Brown, K. L., Taylor, M. N., Anderson, O. P., Thomas, Q. R., White, S. T., Harris, U. V., Martin, W. X., Thompson, Y. Z., Clark, A. B., Lewis, C. D., Walker, E. F., Robinson, G. H., Hall, I. J., ... Garcia, Z. Y. (2021, May 12). Local park renovations begin this summer. *The Daily News*. https://www.dailynews.com/local-park-renovations\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis rule prevents excessive length in citations while still acknowledging the contributions of many authors. It is particularly useful in collaborative works.\n\n### Citing Articles with a Specific Date\n\nWhen citing articles where the specific date is important, use the Year, Month Day format. This is especially relevant for newspapers, magazines, and online articles.\n\n### Example:\nSmith, J. A. (2021, May 12). Local park renovations begin this summer. *The Daily News*. https://www.dailynews.com/local-park-renovations\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis format allows for precise identification of the article, which is crucial for readers who may want to find the original source.\n\n## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Always Double-Check Dates**: Ensure that the date is included and formatted correctly. Errors can lead to difficulties in locating the source.\n2. **Be Mindful of Author Names**: Pay close attention to how author names are presented. Misplacement of initials or incorrect use of suffixes can affect the citation's accuracy.\n3. **Use Proper Formatting**: Italics and capitalization should be used correctly. Only the newspaper title should be italicized, while the article title should be in sentence case.\n4. **Avoid Over-Citation**: While it is important to cite sources, excessive citations can clutter your work. Be selective and relevant in your citations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding how to cite newspaper articles in APA style, including special cases and edge cases, is essential for clear communication in academic writing. By following the outlined formats and being aware of potential pitfalls, you can ensure that your citations are accurate and effective. Proper citation not only enhances the credibility of your work but also helps readers to trace your sources, reinforcing academic integrity.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How do I cite a newspaper article in APA format?\n\nTo cite a newspaper article in APA format, you need to include several key elements. Start with the author's last name and initials, followed by the publication date in parentheses. Next, include the title of the article in sentence case, followed by the name of the newspaper in italics. Finally, provide the URL if the article is available online. For example: Smith, J. (2023, March 15). Understanding climate change. The Daily News. https://www.dailynews.com/understanding-climate-change. If the article does not have a DOI or URL, you can omit that part. For more detailed guidelines, refer to the official APA Publication Manual or visit the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### What if the newspaper article has no author?\n\nIf a newspaper article does not have a specific author, you can begin the citation with the title of the article. The format would be similar to a standard citation, but you will replace the author\u2019s name with the article title. For instance: Understanding climate change. (2023, March 15). The Daily News. https://www.dailynews.com/understanding-climate-change. Remember to keep the title in sentence case and italics for the newspaper name. This situation often occurs with editorial pieces or news articles from larger organizations. For more information, check the APA Style website for guidance on citing works with no author.\n\n---\n\n### How do I cite a newspaper article from a database?\n\nCiting a newspaper article from a database in APA format follows a similar structure to citing a print article. You will still include the author's name, publication date, article title, and newspaper name. However, if the article is accessed through a database, you should include the name of the database at the end of the citation, without a URL. For example: Smith, J. (2023, March 15). Understanding climate change. The Daily News. ProQuest. If the article is available online and has a DOI, include that instead of the database name. For more detailed guidance, consider checking resources like the Purdue OWL or the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### How do I format the title of a newspaper article in my citation?\n\nIn APA format, the title of a newspaper article should be in sentence case. This means that you only capitalize the first letter of the first word of the title and any proper nouns. For example, 'Understanding climate change' is correct, while 'Understanding Climate Change' is not. The title should not be italicized or placed in quotation marks. Make sure to follow this format consistently across all your citations. If you are unsure about sentence case, resources like the APA Style website provide additional clarity and examples to help you.\n\n---\n\n### What if I am citing a specific section of a newspaper article?\n\nWhen citing a specific section of a newspaper article, you can include a specific page number or section heading in your in-text citation. For example, if you are referencing information found on page A3 of an article, your in-text citation might look like this: (Smith, 2023, p. A3). In your reference list, you would still include the full citation of the article without any changes. If you are highlighting a specific section such as an editorial or a column within the article, make sure to clarify that in your writing. For further details, see the APA Style website for guidance on in-text citations.\n\n---\n\n### Can I use an online news source as a citation in my work?\n\nYes, you can use online news sources as citations in your work, provided they are credible and reliable. When citing an online news article, follow the same APA guidelines as you would for print articles. Include the author's name, publication date, article title, newspaper name in italics, and the URL at the end. For example: Smith, J. (2023, March 15). Understanding climate change. The Daily News. https://www.dailynews.com/understanding-climate-change. Always ensure that the online source is reputable, such as established newspapers or news organizations. For more information, you might want to explore resources on evaluating sources or the APA Style website for citation guidance.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n<div class=\"related-box\">\n<h3>Related Source Types</h3>\n<div class=\"related-grid\">\n<a href=\"/how-to-cite-book-apa/\" class=\"related-link\">\ud83d\udcd6 How to Cite Books</a>\n<a href=\"/how-to-cite-website-apa/\" class=\"related-link\">\ud83c\udf10 How to Cite Websites</a>\n<a href=\"/how-to-cite-conference-paper-apa/\" class=\"related-link\">\ud83d\udcc4 How to Cite Conference Papers</a>\n<a href=\"/how-to-cite-book-chapter-apa/\" class=\"related-link\">\ud83d\udcda How to Cite Book Chapters</a>\n<a href=\"/how-to-cite-dissertation-apa/\" class=\"related-link\">\ud83c\udf93 How to Cite Dissertations</a>\n<a href=\"/how-to-cite-dataset-apa/\" class=\"related-link\">\ud83d\udcca How to Cite Datasets</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26\n**Reading Time:** 10 minutes",
