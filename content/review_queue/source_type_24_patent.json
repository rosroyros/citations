These rules ensure consistency and clarity, which are essential in academic writing. This guide will detail how to cite patents correctly, provide examples, and explain why these rules are important.\n\n### Basic Format for Patent Citations\n\nThe basic format for citing a patent in APA 7th edition is as follows:\n\n**Patent Number.** (Year). Title of the patent. U.S. Patent Office. URL\n\nHere is a breakdown of this format:\n\n1. **Patent Number:** This is the unique number assigned to the patent.\n2. **Year:** The year the patent was granted.\n3. **Title of the Patent:** This should be in italics.\n4. **U.S. Patent Office:** The agency that issued the patent.\n5. **URL:** If the patent is available online, include the direct link.\n\n### Detailed Example of a Patent Citation\n\nLet\u2019s look at a specific example to illustrate the format:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nU.S. Patent No. 123,456. (2021). Innovative widget design. U.S. Patent Office. https://www.example.com/patent/123456\n\nIn this example:\n- The patent number is displayed as \"U.S. Patent No. 123,456.\"\n- The year of issue is 2021.\n- The title \"Innovative widget design\" is italicized.\n- The issuing agency is stated clearly.\n- The URL provides direct access to the patent.\n\n### Citing Multiple Inventors\n\nWhen a patent has multiple inventors, all inventors should be listed. The format is similar to how authors are cited in other reference types. The names should be inverted, and the last name is followed by the initials of the first and middle names, if available. \n\n**Example 2:**\n\nU.S. Patent No. 654,321. (2020). Method for efficient energy consumption. U.S. Patent Office. https://www.example.com/patent/654321\n\nInventors: Smith, J.A., & Doe, R.B.\n\nIn this case:\n- Both inventors are listed with their last names first, followed by their initials.\n- The names are separated by an ampersand (&) because they are in a reference list.\n  \n### Citing Patents with More Than Two Inventors\n\nWhen citing a patent with three or more inventors, list the first inventor followed by \"et al.\" in the narrative citation if you refer to it in the text. However, in the reference list, all inventors need to be included.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nU.S. Patent No. 789,012. (2019). Advanced robotic arm. U.S. Patent Office. https://www.example.com/patent/789012\n\nInventors: Johnson, L.K., Smith, J.A., Doe, R.B., & Lee, T.C.\n\nIn this instance:\n- All four inventors are listed in the reference entry.\n- In a narrative citation, it would appear as \"Johnson et al. (2019)\" in-text.\n\n### Why These Rules Matter\n\nAdhering to the citation format is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Clarity:** A consistent format helps readers quickly identify the type of source being cited. This is especially important in academic writing, where clarity is paramount.\n2. **Credibility:** Proper citation of patents lends credibility to your work. It shows that you have done your research and are referencing relevant sources accurately.\n3. **Avoiding Plagiarism:** Accurate citations help to ensure that you give proper credit to the original inventors and sources. This is essential in maintaining academic integrity.\n\n### Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Double-check Patent Numbers:** Always verify the patent number to ensure accuracy. Errors in the patent number can lead readers to incorrect or non-existent sources.\n2. **Use Italics Correctly:** Ensure that the title of the patent is in italics. This is a common mistake that can detract from the professionalism of your work.\n3. **Keep URLs Updated:** If you are citing an online patent, ensure that the URL is working and leads directly to the intended patent. Dead links can confuse readers and detract from your work's credibility.\n4. **Be Mindful of Author Credits:** If a patent has many inventors, remember to follow the rules regarding listing them. Do not omit any inventors in the reference list.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCiting patents in APA 7th edition is a systematic process that requires attention to detail. By following the outlined formats and understanding the significance of these rules, you can ensure that your citations are accurate, clear, and credible. This not only enhances the quality of your work but also respects the contributions of inventors and researchers in your field.\n\n---\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions\n\n## What You Need\n\nBefore you begin creating a patent citation in APA 7th edition, gather the following materials:\n\n1. **Patent Document**: Ensure you have the full citation details of the patent. This includes the inventor's name, patent number, year of issue, title of the patent, and the issuing authority.\n2. **Computer or Device**: You will need a device to type the citation.\n3. **Internet Access**: To look up any missing information or examples if needed.\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating a Patent Citation\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Author Information\n\n**Action**: Determine the inventor's name from the patent document. \n\n**Verification**: Ensure you have the full name, which includes the first, middle, and last names, if applicable.\n\n**Time Estimate**: 2 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: If there are multiple inventors, write them down simultaneously to save time.\n\n### Step 2: Format the Author's Name\n\n**Action**: Format the inventor's name according to APA style. Use the format of last name first, followed by a comma, then the initials of the first and middle names. \n\n**Verification**: Check that the initials are separated by periods and that there are no spaces between them (e.g., Smith, J.R.).\n\n**Time Estimate**: 3 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: If there are multiple inventors, format them as you go to avoid confusion later on.\n\n### Step 3: Include Multiple Authors (If Applicable)\n\n**Action**: If there are two inventors, format both names. Invert the second author's name as well, and use an ampersand (&) between the names. \n\n**Verification**: Ensure the format is consistent with APA style (e.g., Smith, J.R. & Doe, A.B.).\n\n**Time Estimate**: 3 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: If there are more than two authors, note the first 19, then prepare to include ellipses later.\n\n### Step 4: Note the Patent Number\n\n**Action**: Retrieve the patent number from the document. This usually follows the inventor's name.\n\n**Verification**: Confirm that the patent number is correct and complete.\n\n**Time Estimate**: 2 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: Keep the patent document open while working to easily find this information.\n\n### Step 5: Include the Title of the Patent\n\n**Action**: Write down the title of the patent in italics. \n\n**Verification**: Ensure the title matches exactly as it appears in the patent document.\n\n**Time Estimate**: 2 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: Copy and paste the title directly if you are typing digitally.\n\n### Step 6: Mention the Issuing Authority and Year\n\n**Action**: Identify the year the patent was issued and the name of the issuing authority (e.g., United States Patent and Trademark Office). \n\n**Verification**: Ensure that the year is accurate and that the authority is spelled correctly.\n\n**Time Estimate**: 3 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: Write down the authority's name in full to avoid errors when typing.\n\n### Step 7: Assemble the Citation\n\n**Action**: Combine all the information into a single reference citation. The format should look like this:\n\n- For one inventor: Lastname, F.M. (Year). Title of patent (Patent No. XXXXXX). Issuing Authority.\n- For two inventors: Lastname, F.M. & Lastname, F.M. (Year). Title of patent (Patent No. XXXXXX). Issuing Authority.\n\n**Verification**: Double-check the arrangement, punctuation, and spacing to ensure compliance with APA 7th edition.\n\n**Time Estimate**: 5 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: Create a template to fill in for different patents to speed up future citations.\n\n### Step 8: Review and Finalize\n\n**Action**: Go through the entire citation one last time. Check for any spelling errors, incorrect formatting, or missing information.\n\n**Verification**: Ensure that every element is present, correctly formatted, and complies with APA style.\n\n**Time Estimate**: 5 minutes.\n\n**Tip for Efficiency**: Consider using a citation management tool, which can help you format citations correctly in the future.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you can create a proper patent citation in APA 7th edition. Make sure to take your time with each step to ensure accuracy and compliance with the guidelines. With practice, you will become proficient in creating citations for patents and other sources.\n\n---\n\n## Common Errors for Patent Citation Citations\n\n<div class=\"error-example\">\n<strong>\u274c Proper Noun Capitalization Error</strong>\n<div style=\"font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;

The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. This format applies to all reference types including journal articles, books, and webpages. The author's name should be inverted (last name first) in the reference list only. This rule ensures consistency across all citation formats and makes alphabetical ordering more efficient in reference lists.</li>\n<li>For works with two authors, both names should be inverted (last name first) and separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word 'and'. Each author's name follows the single author format (Last name, initials). The ampersand should be preceded by a comma. This format is used in both reference lists and parenthetical citations, but narrative citations use 'and' instead of '&'. This rule distinguishes APA from other citation styles and maintains consistency across multi-author works.</li>\n<li>For works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. All listed authors follow the standard inverted format. This rule prevents extremely long citation lists while still providing key attribution information. The ellipsis should not be italicized or bracketed. This change from APA 6th edition's 7+ author rule provides more comprehensive author listing.</li>\n<li>Author titles, suffixes, and credentials (like Jr., Sr., II, III, Ph.D., M.D.) should be included in the reference list. Suffixes like Jr., Sr., II, and III follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic and professional credentials are generally omitted from reference list entries but may be included in special circumstances. Titles like Dr., Professor, or military ranks are not included in reference list citations. This rule provides complete identification when needed while avoiding unnecessary credential inflation.</li>\n<li>When including URLs for websites, online documents, or other sources without DOIs, present them as live hyperlinks without any special formatting or punctuation. APA 7 removes the 'Retrieved from' prefix that was required in APA 6 for most URLs. URLs should be presented in their simplest form, beginning with http:// or https://, and should be hyperlinks in digital documents. Do not add a period at the end of a URL unless it is part of the original URL. This simplification makes citations cleaner while maintaining functionality for digital access to sources.</li>\n<li>When a URL or DOI leads to a broken or inactive link, APA 7 provides several options for handling the citation. If the source is available through an archive like the Internet Archive, include the archived URL. If the source cannot be located, include as much information as possible and note that the resource is no longer available. For journal articles with broken DOIs, include the DOI but add a note indicating it's inactive. The principle is to provide enough information for readers to locate the source if possible, while acknowledging access limitations. This represents more detailed guidance than APA 6 provided for handling broken links.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Special Cases\n\n## Understanding Patent Citations in APA Style\n\nCiting patents in APA format can be a nuanced process, particularly when considering special and edge cases. This guide aims to clarify how to properly cite patents according to the APA 7th edition guidelines. It will also address common pitfalls, practical tips, and the importance of adhering to these rules.\n\n### General Format for Patent Citations\n\nThe basic format for citing a patent in APA style is as follows:\n\n**Inventor(s). (Year). Title of patent (U.S. Patent No. xxxxxxx). URL**\n\nHere are the elements you need to include:\n\n1. **Inventor(s):** List the last name followed by the initials of the first and middle names for each inventor. If there are multiple inventors, separate their names with commas, and place an ampersand (&) before the last author\u2019s name.\n2. **Year:** The year the patent was granted.\n3. **Title of patent:** This should be in italics.\n4. **Patent number:** Include the designation (U.S. Patent No.) followed by the patent number.\n5. **URL:** If available, provide a direct link to the patent.\n\n### Special Cases\n\n#### Multiple Inventors\n\nWhen citing patents with multiple inventors, the format remains consistent. However, you must ensure that you follow the correct punctuation and formatting rules.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSmith, J. A., & Doe, R. B. (2020). Innovative Widget Design (U.S. Patent No. 1234567). https://patents.google.com/patent/US1234567\n\nIn this case, both inventors are properly cited with their last names and initials. The ampersand is used to connect their names, making the citation clear and concise.\n\n#### Patents with 21 or More Inventors\n\nWhen a patent has 21 or more inventors, you should list the first 19 inventors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final inventor. This approach prevents the citation from becoming excessively long while still attributing key contributors.\n\n**Example:**\n\nJohnson, L. E., Smith, J. A., Brown, C. D., White, E. F., Black, G. H., Green, I. J., Blue, K. L., Yellow, M. N., Orange, O. P., Purple, Q. R., Pink, S. T., Gray, U. V., Tan, W. X., Violet, Y. Z., Red, A. B., Silver, C. D., Gold, E. F., Copper, G. H., Aluminum, I. J., ... Black, J. K. (2021). Advanced Energy Solutions (U.S. Patent No. 9876543). https://patents.google.com/patent/US9876543\n\nIn this example, the ellipsis indicates that there are additional authors who are not listed, which keeps the citation manageable while still giving credit to the key contributors.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n#### Use of Titles and Suffixes\n\nIn APA style, titles and suffixes for inventors must be included in the reference list. This is particularly important for patents where the inventors may have notable titles or family suffixes.\n\n**Example:**\n\nDoe, J. R., Ph.D., & Smith, A. B., Jr. (2022). Next Generation Widget Technology (U.S. Patent No. 2345678). https://patents.google.com/patent/US2345678\n\nIn this case, both the title (Ph.D.) and suffix (Jr.) are included, following the initials and separated by a comma. This inclusion ensures proper identification of the inventors.\n\n### Practical Tips for Citing Patents\n\n1. **Check for Author Details**: Always verify the correct names and titles of the inventors. Inaccurate names can lead to confusion and misattribution.\n2. **Use Reliable Sources**: Make sure you are obtaining the patent information from reputable sources like official patent offices or well-known patent databases.\n3. **Avoid Excessive Length**: If a patent has too many inventors, remember the rule about using ellipses to keep your citation concise.\n4. **Follow Formatting Rules**: Pay close attention to formatting details, such as italics for the patent title and correct punctuation for names and URLs.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n- **Incorrect Punctuation**: A common mistake is failing to use the correct punctuation, particularly the ampersand and commas when listing multiple authors. Always check your citations for these details.\n- **Omitting URLs**: Failing to include the URL is another frequent oversight. Always provide a link to the patent when available, as this improves access to the source.\n- **Not Including All Authors in Long Citations**: When citing patents with many inventors, it can be easy to inadvertently omit names. Remember to include only the first 19 authors and the final one, using an ellipsis in between.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCiting patents in APA style requires attention to detail and adherence to specific formatting rules. Understanding special cases, such as citing multiple inventors or including titles, is crucial for accurate attribution. By following the guidelines provided here, you can create clear and consistent patent citations that enhance the credibility of your work. Always double-check your citations for accuracy, and remember that clarity in presentation helps ensure that your readers can easily access and verify your sources.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How do I cite a patent in APA format?\n\nTo cite a patent in APA format, you need to include the patent number, the year of issuance, the title of the patent, the inventor's name, and the issuing authority. The basic format is as follows: Inventor's Last Name, Initials. (Year). Title of the patent (Patent No. Number). Issuing Authority. For example, if you were citing a patent by Thomas Edison issued in 1879, it would look like this: Edison, T. A. (1879). Electric lamp (Patent No. 223,898). U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It is important to ensure that all details are accurate, including the correct patent number and the name of the issuing authority. For more detailed information on citing patents, you can refer to the APA Publication Manual or the Purdue OWL website.\n\n---\n\n### What if I want to cite a patent that has multiple inventors?\n\nWhen citing a patent with multiple inventors in APA format, you should list the first inventor's last name followed by their initials, and then use a comma to separate additional inventors. Use an ampersand before the last inventor's name. For example, if you are citing a patent with inventors Smith, Johnson, and Lee, it would be formatted as follows: Smith, J., Johnson, A., & Lee, R. (Year). Title of the patent (Patent No. Number). Issuing Authority. This format ensures that all inventors are credited for their work. It is also important to double-check the order of the inventors as listed in the patent document. For further guidance, the APA Publication Manual offers comprehensive citing instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Can I cite a patent I found online, and how should I do it?\n\nYes, you can cite a patent found online in APA format. The citation should include the same elements as a traditional patent citation, with the addition of the URL. The format is: Inventor's Last Name, Initials. (Year). Title of the patent (Patent No. Number). Issuing Authority. URL. For example, if you found a patent on the USPTO website, you would format it like this: Edison, T. A. (1879). Electric lamp (Patent No. 223,898). U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. https://www.uspto.gov/patents/223898. Make sure to include the full URL to ensure that readers can access the patent directly. For more detailed guidance, you may refer to the APA Style website.\n\n---\n\n### What if the patent is from a foreign country? How should I cite it?\n\nWhen citing a foreign patent in APA format, you should follow the same structure as you would for a U.S. patent. However, you need to specify the country of issuance. The format is: Inventor's Last Name, Initials. (Year). Title of the patent (Patent No. Number). Issuing Authority, Country. For example: M\u00fcller, H. (2005). Innovative device (Patent No. DE102005000123). Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt, Germany. It is crucial to provide the correct issuing authority and country to avoid confusion. If you are unsure about the patent format specific to a country, check the respective patent office's guidelines or the APA Publication Manual for assistance.\n\n---\n\n### Is it necessary to include the patent number in the citation?\n\nYes, including the patent number in your citation is essential when citing a patent in APA format. The patent number serves as a unique identifier that allows readers to locate the specific patent you are referencing. Omitting this detail could lead to confusion, especially if multiple patents exist for similar titles or inventions. The correct format is: Inventor's Last Name, Initials. (Year). Title of the patent (Patent No. Number). Issuing Authority. For example, if you are citing a patent for a new type of battery, make sure to include its exact patent number. This practice aligns with scholarly standards and enhances the credibility of your work. For additional guidance, refer to the APA Style website or the Publication Manual.\n\n---\n\n### How should I handle a patent that is pending?\n\nWhen citing a pending patent in APA format, you should indicate that the patent is pending by including the phrase 'Patent pending' in the citation. The format is: Inventor's Last Name, Initials. (Year). Title of the patent (Patent pending). Issuing Authority. For instance, if you are citing a pending patent by Jane Doe, it would look like this: Doe, J. (2023). New invention (Patent pending). U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It is important to clarify its status as pending, as this indicates that the patent has not yet been officially granted. This distinction helps readers understand the current legal status of the invention. For more information on how to cite pending patents, you can consult the APA Publication Manual or relevant online resources.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26\n**Reading Time:** 10 minutes",
