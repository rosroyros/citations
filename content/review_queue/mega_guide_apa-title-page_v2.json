Professional papers may include a running head, but it's optional. If you include one, it should be flush left in all caps, maximum 50 characters, with the page number flush right.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I format author affiliations for multiple authors from different institutions?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">List each author on a separate line, followed by their complete affiliation information on the next line. If authors share the same affiliation, list the affiliation once after all authors from that institution. Use superscript numbers to match authors to their affiliations when necessary.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">Should I include my professional titles (Dr., Professor) on the title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">Student papers should not include professional titles. Professional papers may include relevant academic degrees (Ph.D., M.A., etc.) after author names, but should avoid professional titles unless specifically required by the publication or institution.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What font should I use for my APA title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">APA recommends Times New Roman 12-point font, but allows alternatives including Calibri, Arial, Georgia 11-point. Choose one font and use it consistently throughout your entire document. Ensure all text is easily readable and professional in appearance.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I create a title page for a group project with equal contributions?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">List all group members as co-authors on the title page. If contributions are equal, you may want to include a statement in the author note explaining that all authors contributed equally. Determine author order alphabetically or by mutual agreement, and ensure all members approve the final submission.</div>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Conclusion\n\nMastering APA title page design and formatting is essential for creating professional academic documents.
