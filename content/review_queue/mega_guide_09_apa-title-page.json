It sets the tone for the work, provides essential information, and adheres to specific formatting rules. This guide will cover the structure and elements required for a well-formatted APA title page according to the 7th edition of the APA Publication Manual.\n\n### General Structure of the Title Page\n\nAn APA title page includes the following elements:\n\n1. **Title of the Paper**\n2. **Author's Name**\n3. **Institutional Affiliation**\n4. **Course Name and Number**\n5. **Instructor's Name**\n6. **Due Date**\n\nThese components are typically centered on the page in the upper half. The title page should be double-spaced, and the font should be a legible size, usually 12-point Times New Roman, 11-point Arial, or 11-point Calibri.\n\n### Title of the Paper\n\nThe title should be concise yet descriptive. It should summarize the main idea of the paper and clearly convey its focus. Here are some key points regarding the title:\n\n- **Format**: The title should be bold and centered at the top of the page.\n- **Length**: Aim for a title that is no more than 12 words long.\n- **Capitalization**: Use title case, meaning that major words are capitalized, while minor words (like \"and,\" \"in,\" or \"of\") are not unless they start the title.\n\n**Example**:  \n**Correct**: *The Effects of Sleep on Academic Performance*  \n**Incorrect**: *the effects of sleep on academic performance*\n\n### Author's Name\n\nThe author\u2019s name should follow the title and be centered on the page as well. The format for the name should be:\n\n- **First Name**: Initials only\n- **Last Name**: Full last name\n\n**Example**:  \n**Correct**: *Jane D. Smith*  \n**Incorrect**: *Smith, Jane* \n\n### Institutional Affiliation\n\nThe institutional affiliation indicates where the author is affiliated. This is typically the university or organization that the author belongs to. This should also be centered below the author\u2019s name.\n\n**Example**:  \n**Correct**: *University of California, Los Angeles*  \n**Incorrect**: *UCLA*\n\n### Course Name and Number\n\nThis element provides context for the paper and should be included below the institutional affiliation. It should be written in full without abbreviations.\n\n**Example**:  \n**Correct**: *Psychology 101: Introduction to Psychology*  \n**Incorrect**: *PSY 101*\n\n### Instructor's Name\n\nIt is important to include the instructor's name, as it identifies who the paper is submitted to. This should be centered and written in the same format as the previous elements.\n\n**Example**:  \n**Correct**: *Dr. Robert A. Johnson*  \n**Incorrect**: *Johnson, R.*\n\n### Due Date\n\nThe due date of the assignment is included at the bottom of the title page. This should be formatted in the same way as the previous entries.\n\n**Example**:  \n**Correct**: *March 15, 2023*  \n**Incorrect**: *3/15/23*\n\n### Formatting Considerations\n\n- **Margins**: Use 1-inch margins on all sides.\n- **Page Number**: The title page should include a page number in the top right corner. The number should be flush right and in the same font size as the rest of the text.\n- **Spacing**: The entire title page must be double-spaced, including the title, author\u2019s name, and any other elements.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Incorrect Title Formatting**: Ensure the title is centered and in bold. Many people forget to bold the title or center it correctly.\n2. **Improper Author Name Format**: Avoid writing the author's name in reverse order or omitting initials.\n3. **Using Abbreviations**: Do not abbreviate the institutional affiliation or course name.\n4. **Omitting the Due Date**: Always include the due date for clarity.\n\n### Practical Tips\n\n- **Review Example Title Pages**: Familiarize yourself with example title pages to better understand formatting.\n- **Use Tools**: Consider using citation management tools or templates to help structure your title page correctly.\n- **Proofread**: Always double-check for typos or formatting errors before submission.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe title page is a crucial part of any APA-style paper. Following the outlined guidelines ensures clarity and professionalism in your academic writing. Pay careful attention to formatting details including the title, author name, and required affiliations. By adhering to these rules and avoiding common mistakes, you can create a title page that effectively introduces your work and meets APA standards.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Comprehensive Examples\n\n<div class=\"example-box\">\n<div class=\"example-variation\">The impact of social media on adolescent mental health: A longitudinal study</div>\n<div class=\"citation-example\">\nChen, L., & Williams, K.

single authors are formatted with last name followed by a comma and first and middle initials. The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. This format applies to all reference types including journal articles, books, and webpages. The author's name should be inverted (last name first) in the reference list only. This rule ensures consistency across all citation formats and makes alphabetical ordering more efficient in reference lists.</li>\n<li>For works with two authors, both names should be inverted (last name first) and separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word 'and'. Each author's name follows the single author format (Last name, initials). The ampersand should be preceded by a comma. This format is used in both reference lists and parenthetical citations, but narrative citations use 'and' instead of '&'. This rule distinguishes APA from other citation styles and maintains consistency across multi-author works.</li>\n<li>For works with three to twenty authors, list all authors in the reference list. Each author's name should be inverted (last name first) with initials. Authors should be separated by commas, with an ampersand (&) before the final author's name. This represents a significant change from APA 6th edition, which used 'et al.' for works with seven or more authors. This rule ensures proper attribution to all contributors while maintaining readability for moderately sized author groups.</li>\n<li>For works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. All listed authors follow the standard inverted format. This rule prevents extremely long citation lists while still providing key attribution information. The ellipsis should not be italicized or bracketed. This change from APA 6th edition's 7+ author rule provides more comprehensive author listing.</li>\n<li>When an organization, corporation, or government agency is the author, use the full official name of the organization. Do not invert organizational names or use initials unless the organization is commonly known by its abbreviation (like APA or NIH). The organization name should be written out completely in the first mention, with abbreviations in brackets if they will be used subsequently. This rule ensures proper attribution for corporate and institutional authors while maintaining clarity for readers.</li>\n<li>Government authors should include the specific agency or department as the author. When parent departments are relevant to identification, they can be included in the publisher position instead of the author position. Use the most specific agency name as the author. For example, use 'National Institute of Mental Health' rather than 'U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Mental Health.' This rule provides clear attribution while avoiding unnecessarily long author names.</li>\n<li>When no author is listed and the work cannot be attributed to a specific organization, move the title to the author position, followed by the date. Do not use 'Anonymous' as the author unless the work is actually signed 'Anonymous.' For works truly signed 'Anonymous,' treat 'Anonymous' as the author name. This rule ensures that readers can identify works by their titles when authorship is unknown while maintaining the standard reference format structure.</li>\n<li>Author titles, suffixes, and credentials (like Jr., Sr., II, III, Ph.D., M.D.) should be included in the reference list. Suffixes like Jr., Sr., II, and III follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic and professional credentials are generally omitted from reference list entries but may be included in special circumstances. Titles like Dr., Professor, or military ranks are not included in reference list citations. This rule provides complete identification when needed while avoiding unnecessary credential inflation.</li>\n<li>When authors share the same surname, include their first initials even when there are multiple authors. This prevents confusion between different authors with identical last names. The standard format remains the same (Last name, initials), but this rule ensures that all authors are properly distinguished. This is particularly important in reference list ordering and when readers need to distinguish between works by different authors with common surnames.</li>\n<li>Authors with double surnames (like Hernandez Lopez or Van der Wiel) should maintain both parts of the surname in the reference list. Treat the double surname as a single unit with a comma after the complete surname. Do not insert commas between parts of compound surnames unless that is the person's preferred usage. This rule respects cultural naming conventions and ensures accurate identification of authors with complex surnames.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n---\n\n\n## \ud83d\ude4b Frequently Asked Questions\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What should be included on an APA title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">An APA title page should include the title of your paper, your name, your institutional affiliation, the course name and number, the instructor's name, and the due date.

Ensure that the font is double-spaced and that there are no extra spaces between the title, name, and affiliation. For more information on font choices and formatting, refer to the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">Do I need a running head on my APA title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">In the 7th edition of the APA Publication Manual, a running head is no longer required for student papers. However, if you are submitting a professional paper or if your instructor specifies otherwise, you may need to include a running head. If required, the running head should be a shortened version of your title, placed in the header, aligned to the left, and should be in all capital letters. It should also be accompanied by the page number, which is aligned to the right. For detailed guidance on running heads, consult the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I format the page number on the title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">In APA format, the page number should be placed in the upper right corner of the title page. It should be flush with the right margin and should be in the same font and size as the rest of the document. The page number should appear on every page of your paper, including the title page. This numbering should start with '1' on the title page. For more information on page numbering and layout, check the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What if my instructor has specific requirements for the title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">If your instructor has specific requirements for the title page, it is important to follow their guidelines. This may include additional information such as a course code or specific formatting preferences. Always prioritize your instructor's requirements over general APA guidelines, as they may have specific standards for the assignment. If you are unsure, it is a good practice to ask your instructor for clarification. For standard APA guidelines, you can refer to the APA Publication Manual or the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">Can I use a subtitle on my APA title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">Yes, you can use a subtitle on your APA title page. If your paper has a subtitle, it should be placed directly below the main title. The subtitle should also be in title case and centered on the page. It is important to ensure that the subtitle is relevant and adds clarity to the title. Keep in mind that the entire title, including the subtitle, should not exceed 12 words if possible. For more information on using subtitles, refer to the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How should I align the text on the title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">In APA format, all text on the title page should be centered. This includes the title, your name, and your institutional affiliation. The information should be double-spaced and should not have extra spaces between the sections. Each section should be placed one after the other, with the title at the top, followed by your name, and then your institutional affiliation. For student papers, the course information, instructor's name, and due date should be placed below the institutional affiliation. For more detailed formatting guidelines, check the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">Is there a specific margin size for the APA title page?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">Yes, the APA format requires standard margins for the title page. You should set the margins to 1 inch on all sides of the page. This includes the top, bottom, left, and right margins. Ensuring that your title page adheres to these margin requirements helps maintain a professional appearance and aligns with APA standards. For more information on margins and overall document formatting, refer to the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">What should I do if my title is too long?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">If your title is too long, consider revising it to make it more concise while still conveying the main idea of your paper. Aim for a title that is no more than 12 words. You can remove unnecessary words, use abbreviations when appropriate, or focus on the key concepts of your research. A clear and concise title helps readers understand the focus of your paper more effectively. For more tips on crafting a suitable title, refer to the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<div class=\"faq-question\">How do I cite sources on the title page in APA format?</div>\n<div class=\"faq-answer\">On the title page of an APA paper, citations are generally not included. The title page is reserved for the title, author details, and other relevant information. In-text citations and references to sources should be included in the main body of your paper and in the reference list at the end. Ensure that you format your citations according to APA guidelines in those sections. For further guidance on citation styles, refer to the APA Publication Manual or the APA Style website.</div>\n</div>\n\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Related Resources\n\n- [APA Citation Checker](/checker/)\n- [Common APA Errors](/guides/common-errors/)\n- [APA Style Guide](/guides/apa-style/)\n\n---\n\n## \u2728 Conclusion\n\nThis guide provides you with comprehensive knowledge to master APA 7th edition citation format.
