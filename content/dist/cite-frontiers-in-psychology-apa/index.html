<p><strong>Frontiers in Psychology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from Frontiers in Psychology requires careful attention to detail, especially when listing authors. One unique aspect of citing this journal, as with any academic journal, is adhering to the specific rules of the APA 7th edition while recognizing any additional nuances that might arise from the publication itself. In APA 7th edition, when citing a source with up to 20 authors, all authors' surnames and initials are listed in the reference entry. This means for Frontiers in Psychology articles with multiple authors, students must include every author up to the 20th in the citation, separated by commas, with an ampersand before the last author's name. </p>
<p>A common point of confusion for students is the handling of the DOI in citations for Frontiers in Psychology. This journal often emphasizes the importance of including the DOI in its articles, which is consistent with APA guidelines stating that a DOI should be presented as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xxx). Students should ensure that they include this in their reference list, as omitting it can lead to incomplete citations. Additionally, students sometimes mistakenly abbreviate author names or incorrectly format the journal title, which should be italicized and written in title case. </p>
<p>To avoid these common pitfalls, students should double-check each author's name and the DOI, ensuring they adhere to APA guidelines by consulting the APA Manual or reliable online resources. It is also beneficial to use reference management tools like Zotero or EndNote, which can help manage citations accurately. By paying close attention to these details, students can ensure their citations of Frontiers in Psychology articles are precise and complete.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-frontiers-in-psychology">Common Issues When Citing Frontiers in Psychology</h2>
<h3 id="identifying-authors">Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong><br />
Students often encounter difficulties in accurately identifying all authors when citing articles from Frontiers in Psychology. Articles can have multiple authors, and listing them correctly in the citation is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Psychology is a prominent open-access journal that frequently publishes collaborative research involving numerous contributors. The full list of authors is sometimes lengthy and can be overlooked, especially if students quickly scan the article header or abstract.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Navigate to the Article's Page:</strong> Ensure you are on the article's main page, not just an abstract or summary page.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the Authors Section:</strong> Scroll to the top of the article where the authors' names are listed. This is usually right below the article title.<br />
3. <strong>List All Authors:</strong> In APA style, list up to 20 authors by their last name followed by their initials. Use an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author. For more than 20 authors, list the first 19, followed by an ellipsis (...), and then the final author’s name.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., &amp; Brown, A.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., Brown, A., Johnson, L., &amp; Doe, M.</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong><br />
Students sometimes struggle with proper date formatting, particularly when distinguishing between the publication date and other dates like submission or acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Psychology articles often display multiple dates, such as submission, acceptance, and publication dates, which can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Correct Date:</strong> The publication date is what you need for your citation. This is typically found near the top of the article or in the PDF version.<br />
2. <strong>Format in APA Style:</strong> Use the year only in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Psychology. (2023, March 15).</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Psychology. (2023).</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong><br />
Properly including URLs in citations is another common problem. Students may either omit the URL or use incorrect formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Psychology is an open-access journal, meaning all articles should be freely accessible online. However, students might copy the URL from the browser which can be long or include unnecessary session data.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the DOI URL:</strong> Preferably, use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) link, which is a permanent and stable URL.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the DOI:</strong> This can typically be found on the article's main page or in the citation information section.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.00001/full</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.00001</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong><br />
Students occasionally cite articles as if they require special access when they are, in fact, open-access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Psychology is an open-access journal, but students sometimes mistakenly assume all academic journals require subscriptions or institutional access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Recognize Open Access:</strong> Understand that Frontiers in Psychology provides free access to its articles for everyone.<br />
2. <strong>No Need for Access Date:</strong> Since the articles are always available, you don’t need to include the date of access in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved March 15, 2023, from https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.00001</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.00001</p>
<p>By following these guidelines, students can effectively navigate the unique challenges of citing articles from Frontiers in Psychology, ensuring their work adheres to APA 7th edition standards.</p>
