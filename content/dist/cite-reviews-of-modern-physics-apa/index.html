<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Reviews of Modern Physics-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from <em>Reviews of Modern Physics</em> in APA 7th edition requires attention to specific formatting details that can differ from general citation rules. This journal is a well-regarded source in the field of physics, and its citation requires careful attention to the publisher’s unique style. When citing articles from this journal, students must ensure they include the article title, journal name in italics, volume number in italics, issue number in parentheses (if available), and page range. The DOI should be added at the end of the citation if available. For instance, a typical citation might look like this: Author(s). (Year). Title of the article. <em>Reviews of Modern Physics, Volume</em>(Issue), page range. DOI.</p>
<p>One of the distinct features of citing <em>Reviews of Modern Physics</em> is the emphasis on precision in the volume and page numbers due to the high frequency of citations in academic work. Unlike some journals, <em>Reviews of Modern Physics</em> may not always include issue numbers, so students should not add an issue number unless it is explicitly provided. A common point of confusion arises with the inclusion of multiple authors. In APA 7th edition, if there are up to 20 authors, they should all be listed, with an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author’s name. </p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should pay close attention to the publisher’s guidelines, especially regarding the DOI format, which should always be presented as a hyperlink: https://doi.org/xxxx. Best practices include reviewing the journal’s specific issues for any additional citation nuances and utilizing citation management tools to ensure accuracy. Additionally, when in doubt, consulting the APA 7th edition manual or utilizing academic databases like PubMed for correctly formatted citations can provide clarity and prevent errors.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-reviews-of-modern-physics">Common Issues When Citing Reviews of Modern Physics</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct author(s) when citing articles from Reviews of Modern Physics. This can occur due to the presence of multiple contributors, such as editors and collaborators, which might be listed prominently.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Reviews of Modern Physics often features comprehensive review articles that can have a large number of contributors. Additionally, the journal sometimes highlights editors or collaborative efforts, which may confuse students about who the primary authors are.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the article's title page or abstract section where the primary authors are listed. This information is typically found at the beginning of the article.<br />
2. Ensure you are selecting the authors directly associated with the content of the article, not editors or other contributors listed in different roles.<br />
3. Use the names as they appear in the publication, maintaining the order and formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> John Smith, editor<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Jane Doe, James Brown</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may encounter confusion with the date format when citing articles from Reviews of Modern Physics, especially when articles include both the publication date and the date of online availability.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal may provide multiple dates, such as when the article was received, accepted, and published online, leading to uncertainty about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the publication date for the citation, which is typically found on the first page of the article or in the citation details provided by the journal.<br />
2. If only an online publication date is available, use that date.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Received: March 15, 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> 2023</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently have issues with how to handle URLs when citing articles from Reviews of Modern Physics, especially when the URLs are lengthy and complex.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal often uses DOI links or institutional access URLs, which can appear cumbersome and may not be straightforward for direct citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Prefer using the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) when available, as it provides a permanent link to the article.<br />
2. Format it as a hyperlink in your citation. For example: https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.XX.YY</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.XX.YY<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.XX.YY</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Determining access requirements for articles can be a challenge, as students may face paywalls or institutional login requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Reviews of Modern Physics is a subscription-based journal, meaning full access to articles often requires institutional access or a personal subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if your institution has a subscription to the journal. Access the article through your library’s portal if available.<br />
2. If access is restricted, consider using interlibrary loan services or contacting the author directly for a copy.<br />
3. For citation purposes, if you accessed the article through an institutional login, omit the URL or include the DOI.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Accessed via university library proxy<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Omit URL, focus on DOI</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges with specific solutions tailored to Reviews of Modern Physics, students can ensure their citations are accurate and comply with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
