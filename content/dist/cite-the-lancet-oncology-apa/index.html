<p><strong>The Lancet Oncology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from <em>The Lancet Oncology</em> in APA 7th edition, one of the unique aspects is that <em>The Lancet</em> series journals, including <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>, often have a particular format for author names and article titles. Typically, APA guidelines require listing up to 20 authors by their last names and initials. In the case of <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>, this rule remains consistent, but students should be particularly attentive to the presentation of author names, ensuring that each name is followed by their initials without additional spaces or punctuation that is not required. Additionally, the title of the article should be in sentence case, meaning only the first word of the title, the first word of any subtitle, and proper nouns are capitalized. </p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises with the journal's title itself, which should be italicized and capitalized as follows: <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>. Students sometimes mistakenly format the journal title incorrectly or forget to italicize it, which can lead to errors in their reference list. Another potential pitfall is the DOI or URL inclusion. Ensure the DOI is formatted as a URL (https://doi.org/...), which is a requirement in APA 7th edition, or provide the URL if no DOI is available. Best practices include double-checking the publisher's guidelines for any specific updates and ensuring consistency throughout the reference list. By carefully attending to these details, students can avoid common errors and ensure their citations are both precise and professional.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-the-lancet-oncology">Common Issues When Citing The Lancet Oncology</h2>
<p><strong>Finding Authors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Students often face difficulty identifying the correct authors for articles published in The Lancet Oncology. This is primarily because the journal sometimes lists a large number of authors, and students may be unsure about who to include or how to format the author list.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> The Lancet Oncology, like many other medical journals, often publishes collaborative research involving many contributors. This can make it difficult to determine the primary authors, especially if the article lists group authorship or uses terms like "on behalf of" a research group.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <br />
1. <strong>Identify all authors</strong> as listed in the article. The Lancet Oncology typically lists authors at the beginning of the article.<br />
2. <strong>Follow APA guidelines</strong> for listing authors. For 20 authors or fewer, list all the authors. For more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis and the final author's name.<br />
3. <strong>Use the format</strong>: Last name, First initial. Middle initial., for each author.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Incorrectly listing only a few of the authors.</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Smith, J. A., Doe, E. B., Johnson, L. C., &amp; The Lancet Oncology Collaborative Group. (Year). Title of article. The Lancet Oncology, Volume(Issue), Page range. DOI
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Date Formats</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Incorrect formatting of the publication date is a common error. Students may mistakenly use the date they accessed the article instead of the publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> The Lancet Oncology articles are often accessed online, and students might confuse the publication date with the access date, especially if the article was published in advance online.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <br />
1. <strong>Locate the publication date</strong> in the article details, typically found near the author information or at the end of the article.<br />
2. <strong>Format the date</strong> in APA style: year only, unless the full date is required for early online publication articles.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Using the access date or incorrect year format.</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Doe, J. (2023). 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>URL Handling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Students often improperly format URLs or include unnecessary proxy URLs when citing The Lancet Oncology articles accessed online.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> URLs from academic databases or library proxies may be long and complex, which can lead to confusion about what to include in a citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <br />
1. <strong>Use the DOI</strong> if available, as it is preferred over URLs in APA citations.<br />
2. <strong>Include a stable URL</strong> only if a DOI is not available. Ensure it leads directly to the article.<br />
3. <strong>Avoid proxy URLs</strong> by copying the direct link from the publisher's site.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Retrieved from http://proxy.universitylibrary.edu/lancet/article
</code></pre>
<p><strong>After:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00000-0
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Access Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue:</strong> There can be confusion over how to cite articles that are behind a paywall or require subscription access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong> The Lancet Oncology is a subscription-based journal, and students might not know how to acknowledge this restricted access in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <br />
1. <strong>Do not include access notes</strong> such as “Retrieved from” or “Accessed on” for subscription-only articles in APA citations.<br />
2. <strong>Rely on DOIs</strong>, as they do not change regardless of access restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Retrieved from http://www.lancet.com/oncology
</code></pre>
<p><strong>After:</strong></p>
<pre><code>https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00000-0
</code></pre>
<p>These tailored solutions help students effectively navigate the unique challenges posed by citing The Lancet Oncology, ensuring compliance with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
