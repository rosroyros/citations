<h2 id="quick-reference-ieee-transactions-on-pattern-analysis-and-machine-intelligence-citations">Quick Reference: IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) requires attention to specific formatting requirements that differ from general citation rules. In the IEEE citation style, which is commonly used for engineering and technical fields, the format for journal articles is precise. For TPAMI, you must include the authors' initials followed by their last names, the title of the article in quotation marks, the journal name in italics, the volume and issue number, the page range, the month and year of publication, and a DOI if available. Unlike APA, which lists up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, IEEE lists all authors for up to six names. If there are more than six authors, cite the first author followed by "et al."</p>
<p>Students often confuse the placement of article titles and the use of abbreviations for the journal name. It's essential to note that IEEE uses standardized abbreviations for journal titles, so "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence" should be abbreviated as "IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell." Furthermore, unlike APA's capitalization rules, IEEE capitalizes only the first word of the article title and proper nouns. A common point of confusion is how to sequence the elements, particularly the volume and issue numbers, which should be formatted as "vol. X, no. Y," and not just the number.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should familiarize themselves with the IEEE Style Manual, which provides detailed examples and explanations. Double-checking the abbreviation of the journal title and ensuring the correct use of capitalization are crucial steps. Using a citation management tool or software that supports IEEE style can also help streamline the process, ensuring adherence to these specific guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-ieee-transactions-on-pattern-analysis-and-machine-intelligence">Common Issues When Citing IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</h2>
<h3 id="issue-1-finding-authors">Issue 1: Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify the authors of articles published in the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). Misidentifying authors can lead to incorrect citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The IEEE Xplore platform, which hosts TPAMI, sometimes lists multiple contributors like editors, reviewers, or contributors from funding organizations alongside the authors. This can create confusion about who should be credited as the authors of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Article:</strong> Navigate to the specific article on IEEE Xplore.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the Author Section:</strong> Look for the section labeled "Authors" on the article's page, typically found below the title or abstract.<br />
3. <strong>Identify the Correct Authors:</strong> Focus on the individuals listed under "Authors" and disregard other contributors unless specified as co-authors.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Editor; Doe, J., Author<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Doe, J.</p>
<h3 id="issue-2-date-formats">Issue 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students often use incorrect date formats when citing TPAMI articles, which can lead to inconsistencies in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IEEE Xplore sometimes lists multiple dates, such as the date of submission, date of acceptance, and date of publication. This can confuse students about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Publication Date:</strong> On the IEEE Xplore article page, identify the official publication date, usually found near the top of the article information.<br />
2. <strong>Use the Correct Format:</strong> Follow the IEEE citation style, which is different from APA. For instance, the date format should be presented as "Year, Month Day" if more specific information is available.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 2023/Feb/15<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> 2023, February 15</p>
<h3 id="issue-3-url-handling">Issue 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students sometimes omit or incorrectly format URLs when citing online TPAMI articles, affecting the citation's completeness and accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The IEEE citation style does not require URLs for journal articles, but students might mistakenly include them due to habits from other citation styles like APA.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Verify the Citation Style Requirements:</strong> For IEEE, URLs are typically unnecessary for journal articles unless specified.<br />
2. <strong>Exclude the URL:</strong> When citing TPAMI in IEEE format, focus on including the necessary bibliographic information such as volume, issue, and page numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> [Online]. Available: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1234567<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., vol. X, no. Y, pp. ZZZ-ZZZ, Month Year.</p>
<h3 id="issue-4-access-requirements">Issue 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students may cite articles they do not have proper access to, leading to incomplete or inaccurate citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
TPAMI articles often reside behind a paywall, meaning students without institutional access may rely on incomplete information from abstracts or previews.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Ensure Full Access:</strong> Obtain access through institutional subscriptions or libraries to ensure all necessary information is available.<br />
2. <strong>Use Full Citations:</strong> With full access, ensure you gather complete information, including volume, issue, and page numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Partial citation with missing volume or page numbers due to lack of access.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Full and complete citation with all necessary bibliographic details.</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues, students can improve the accuracy and completeness of their citations for articles from the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, aligning with the specific requirements of IEEE citation style.</p>
