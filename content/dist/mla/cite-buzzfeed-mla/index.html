<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-buzzfeed-sources-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes BuzzFeed sources tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed articles look like regular web pages, but they often include features that can complicate MLA citations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple contributors (writers, editors, producers).</li>
<li>List-style headlines that read like titles, sometimes with punctuation, numbers, or slang.</li>
<li>Frequent updates.</li>
<li>Content that appears under a section label (for example, “BuzzFeed News” or “Shopping”) while still living on the BuzzFeed site.</li>
<li>Missing information, especially missing authors or unclear publication dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA 9 handles these issues by focusing on a few core pieces of information, in a consistent order. Your goal is to help a reader quickly find the exact BuzzFeed page you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-9-format-for-a-buzzfeed-article">
<h2 >The basic MLA 9 format for a BuzzFeed article</h2>
<p>Use this general structure for most BuzzFeed web articles:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Article.” <em>Website Name</em>, Publisher (if different), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>In practice, BuzzFeed citations usually look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Article.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-each-part-means">What each part means</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: The person who wrote the article. This is usually near the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>“Title of Article”</strong>: The page title, put in quotation marks because it is a short work within a website.</li>
<li><strong>Website Name</strong>: Usually <em>BuzzFeed</em> (italicized).</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: Often omitted because the site name and publisher are effectively the same for BuzzFeed pages. If your instructor expects it, you can include BuzzFeed as publisher, but it is usually redundant.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: Use the publication date shown on the page. If there is an updated date, MLA usually prefers the date most relevant to the version you used. If the page clearly says “Updated,” you can cite the posted date or the updated date based on what you relied on, but be consistent.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: Use the stable URL for the page.</li>
<li><strong>Accessed date</strong>: Recommended for web pages, especially when content can change.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-for-buzzfeed-citations">
<h2 >Author rules you must follow for BuzzFeed citations</h2>
<p>Your rules change how you handle the author element. This matters because MLA citations are alphabetized by the first element in the entry, and because correct author formatting helps readers identify and credit the right person.</p>
<h3 id="one-author">One author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the author’s <strong>full first name</strong>, not initials.</li>
<li>Invert the name: <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- <strong>Lopez, Maria Elena.</strong></p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted.</li>
<li>Second author is in normal order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- <strong>Lopez, Maria Elena, and Jordan Michael Lee.</strong></p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>List only the first author (inverted, full first name).</li>
<li>Add <strong>et al.</strong> after the first author.</li>
<li>Do not list the other names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- <strong>Lopez, Maria Elena, et al.</strong></p>
<h3 id="no-author">No author</h3>
<p>If no author is listed on the BuzzFeed page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the title.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous.”</li>
<li>Do not use “n.d.”</li>
<li>Alphabetize by the first important word in the title, ignoring A, An, and The.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- <strong>“27 Recipes You Can Make in a Dorm Room.”</strong></p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-and-capitalization-for-buzzfeed-pages">
<h2 >Titles and capitalization for BuzzFeed pages</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed titles often include numbers, slang, or unusual punctuation. In MLA 9:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the <strong>article title in quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>title case</strong>, which means you capitalize the first word, the last word, and all major words in between.</li>
<li>Keep the original wording, including numbers and intentional spelling, unless it is clearly an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:<br />
- “19 Times This Dog Was the Real Hero”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-on-buzzfeed-what-to-do-when-they-are-missing-or-confusing">
<h2 >Dates on BuzzFeed, what to do when they are missing or confusing</h2>
<h3 id="if-a-date-is-provided">If a date is provided</h3>
<p>Use the date as shown, in MLA format: <strong>Day Month Year</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
- 14 Mar. 2024</p>
<p>Many instructors accept MLA’s month abbreviations with a period (Mar., Apr., Sept.). If you want to keep things very simple and consistent, you can use the standard MLA abbreviations.</p>
<h3 id="if-no-date-is-provided">If no date is provided</h3>
<p>MLA allows you to omit the date if it is not available. Do not insert “n.d.” under your rules.</p>
<p>So the citation simply moves from website name to URL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author. “Title.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because BuzzFeed content can change, the accessed date becomes more important when the publication date is missing.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="urls-and-access-dates-how-to-format-them">
<h2 >URLs and access dates, how to format them</h2>
<h3 id="urls">URLs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy the full URL from the address bar.</li>
<li>MLA does not require “https://” in every case, but it is acceptable to include it. The key is consistency across your Works Cited.</li>
<li>Remove tracking junk if you can, but do not break the link.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accessed-date">Accessed date</h3>
<p>Include an accessed date when:<br />
- The page has no publication date.<br />
- The content is likely to change.<br />
- You are using a page that updates.</p>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.</strong></p>

<h2 >Examples (with explanations)</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-one-author-buzzfeed-article">
<h2 >Example 1, one author BuzzFeed article</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Lopez, Maria Elena. “19 Times This Dog Was the Real Hero.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, 14 Mar. 2024, https://www.buzzfeed.com/example/this-dog-was-the-real-hero. Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Author name</strong> follows your rule, full first name, and inverted as <strong>Lopez, Maria Elena</strong>.<br />
- <strong>Title</strong> is in quotation marks because it is a page within the BuzzFeed website.<br />
- <strong>Website name</strong> is italicized as <em>BuzzFeed</em>.<br />
- <strong>Date</strong> is in Day Month Year format.<br />
- <strong>URL</strong> points directly to the page.<br />
- <strong>Accessed date</strong> is included to document when you viewed it, which is useful for web content.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If the page shows both a posted date and an updated date, decide which one matches what you used. If your argument depends on recent changes, use the updated date.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-first-inverted-second-normal-order">
<h2 >Example 2, two authors (first inverted, second normal order)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Patel, Aisha Renée, and Jordan Michael Lee. “What Happens When You Stop Using Your Phone for 24 Hours.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, 8 Oct. 2023, https://www.buzzfeed.com/example/stop-using-your-phone-24-hours. Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted: <strong>Patel, Aisha Renée</strong>.<br />
- The second author is not inverted: <strong>Jordan Michael Lee</strong>.<br />
- The names are joined with <strong>and</strong>, which matches MLA style and your rule.<br />
- Everything else follows the standard web article format.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Do not invert the second author. Writing “Lee, Jordan Michael” would break your rule and also makes MLA entries harder to scan.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-listed-start-with-the-title">
<h2 >Example 3, no author listed, start with the title</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
“27 Recipes You Can Make in a Dorm Room.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, https://www.buzzfeed.com/example/recipes-dorm-room. Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- No author is listed, so the citation begins with the <strong>title</strong>.<br />
- There is no date visible, so the date is omitted. You do not add “n.d.” under your rules.<br />
- The accessed date becomes especially important because the page has no publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Alphabetizing note</strong><br />
In your Works Cited list, this entry would be alphabetized under <strong>27</strong> (numbers are typically treated as they appear). If the title began with “The,” you would ignore “The” for alphabetizing.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<h3 id="they-make-your-works-cited-easy-to-navigate">They make your Works Cited easy to navigate</h3>
<p>MLA formatting is designed so readers can quickly scan a Works Cited page and find entries in alphabetical order. Inverting the first author’s name supports that system.</p>
<h3 id="they-protect-accuracy-and-credit">They protect accuracy and credit</h3>
<p>Using full first names reduces confusion, especially when multiple writers share a last name. It also respects author identity more clearly than initials.</p>

<p>BuzzFeed pages can be updated, moved, or revised. Clean URLs and accessed dates give your reader the best chance of finding what you saw.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips for citing BuzzFeed correctly</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Use the page URL</strong>, not a social media share link.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent</strong> about month abbreviations and whether you include “https://”.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your formatting exact</strong>, quotation marks around article titles, italics for <em>BuzzFeed</em>, and commas in the right places.</li>

<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials</strong> for authors. Your rule requires full first names.</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author</strong> in two-author citations.</li>

<li><strong>Using “n.d.”</strong> when no date is available. Omit the date instead.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the accessed date</strong>, especially when a BuzzFeed page has no clear publication date or is likely to change.</li>
<li><strong>Italicizing the article title</strong> instead of putting it in quotation marks. The website name is italicized, not the page title.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Buzzfeed citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-buzzfeed-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes BuzzFeed citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed content looks simple, but it has several features that create edge cases in MLA 9. Articles may be written by staff writers, credited to “BuzzFeed Staff,” published under a brand page like “BuzzFeed News,” updated after publication, or presented as a quiz, listicle, video, or sponsored post. MLA 9 handles these situations by focusing on a few core questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is responsible for the content, a person or an organization?</li>
<li>What is the title of the specific page you used?</li>
<li>What container holds it, usually <em>BuzzFeed</em>?</li>
<li>What date should you use, and do you need an access date?</li>
<li>What type of BuzzFeed page is it, and does it have extra elements like a quiz result, a video, or a correction note?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your rules about author names matter here because BuzzFeed often presents authors in ways that tempt writers to abbreviate, guess, or treat a group label as a person. MLA citations should be consistent and transparent so a reader can find the exact page you used and understand who created it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-pattern-for-a-buzzfeed-web-page">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 pattern for a BuzzFeed web page</h2>
<p>Most BuzzFeed items are cited as web pages in a periodical type website. A reliable default format is:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Page.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, Publisher (optional), Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>Notes:<br />
- The website title is usually italicized: <em>BuzzFeed</em>.<br />
- The publisher is often omitted in MLA 9 when it is the same as the website title. For BuzzFeed, this is commonly the case.<br />
- Include the full URL, without “https://” if your instructor prefers shortened URLs, but MLA accepts either.<br />
- Use the publication date shown on the page. If the page shows “Updated,” use the updated date only if it clearly reflects the version you consulted, and you can support that choice.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-individual-author-pages-vs-staff-or-team-bylines">
<h2 >Special case 1, Individual author pages vs staff or team bylines</h2>
<h3 id="when-a-person-is-clearly-named">When a person is clearly named</h3>
<p>Use the author exactly as shown, but follow your rule: full first name, not initials. MLA also inverts the first author’s name in Works Cited.</p>
<p>If the page lists “John Smith,” you cite:<br />
- Smith, John.</p>
<p>If the page lists a middle name, include it:<br />
- Smith, John Michael.</p>
<h3 id="when-the-byline-is-a-group-label">When the byline is a group label</h3>
<p>BuzzFeed sometimes uses bylines like “BuzzFeed Staff,” “BuzzFeed News,” or “BuzzFeed Video.” These are corporate authors, not personal names. Do not invert them like a personal name. Treat the organization as the author in normal order.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If the byline is not a person’s full name, do not force it into Last, First format. Keep it as the group name as printed.</p>
<h3 id="when-there-is-no-author-at-all">When there is no author at all</h3>
<p>Some BuzzFeed pages, especially older listicles or embedded content pages, may not show a byline. In MLA 9, you start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous,” and do not invent an author.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Starting with “BuzzFeed” when no author appears. In MLA, the website title is a container, not a replacement author. If there is no author, start with the page title.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-two-authors-and-three-or-more-authors">
<h2 >Special case 2, Two authors and three or more authors</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed collaborations happen, especially in features, quizzes, or news explainers.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>Follow your rule exactly:<br />
- First author inverted.<br />
- Second author in normal order.<br />
- Use “and” between them.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- Last, First Middle, and First Last. “Title.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, date, URL.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>Use only the first author, inverted, followed by “et al.” Do not list the rest.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- Last, First Middle, et al. “Title.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, date, URL.</p>
<p>Why this rule matters: BuzzFeed pages can list multiple contributors, editors, and producers. Listing everyone can become unreadable, and it can also increase the chance of errors. Using “et al.” keeps citations consistent and still credits the lead author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-quizzes-results-pages-and-interactive-content">
<h2 >Special case 3, Quizzes, results pages, and interactive content</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed quizzes can create two different citation targets:</p>
<ol>
<li>The main quiz page, which is stable and shareable.</li>
<li>A personalized results page, which may be unique to a user, may not be stable, and may not be accessible to others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Best practice in MLA: Cite the main quiz page whenever possible. If you must cite a results page, confirm it has a stable URL and a clear title. If it is personalized or session based, cite the main quiz and describe your result in the text of your paper instead of trying to cite an unstable results URL.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Citing a results page link that no one else can open. MLA citations should help readers retrieve the source.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-dates-updates-and-published-vs-updated">
<h2 >Special case 4, Dates, updates, and “published” vs “updated”</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed often shows:<br />
- A publication date.<br />
- An “Updated on” date.<br />
- Sometimes both.</p>
<p>MLA 9 generally uses the date that corresponds to the version you used. If the page is clearly marked as updated and you consulted the updated version, use the updated date. If both are shown and you are unsure which reflects the content you used, you can choose the date that appears most prominently, usually the updated date, because it signals the current version.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If the content is time sensitive, such as breaking news, consider including an access date at the end. MLA 9 makes access dates optional, but they are helpful when content changes.</p>
<p>Format for access date if you use it:<br />
- Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-sponsored-content-and-brand-studios">
<h2 >Special case 5, Sponsored content and brand studios</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed has sponsored posts that may be labeled “Paid Content,” “Presented by,” or tied to a brand studio. These pages can raise the question, who is the author?</p>
<p>Use the author shown on the page. If it is a brand or studio name, treat it as a corporate author. If no author is shown, start with the title.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Do not list the sponsor as the author unless the page actually credits the sponsor as the creator. Sponsorship is not the same as authorship.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-6-video-pages-and-embedded-media">
<h2 >Special case 6, Video pages and embedded media</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed video pages may include a producer name, a channel label, and a publication date. If you are citing the BuzzFeed page that hosts the video, cite it like a web page. If you are citing a video hosted on another platform like YouTube but embedded on BuzzFeed, you should usually cite the original platform entry if that is what you watched and it provides clearer metadata.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Mixing containers. If you cite the BuzzFeed page, the container is <em>BuzzFeed</em>. If you cite the YouTube page, the container is <em>YouTube</em>.</p>

<h2 >Examples with correct formatting and explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-standard-buzzfeed-article-with-one-author">Example 1, Standard BuzzFeed article with one author</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Garcia, Maria Elena. “19 Tiny Kitchen Habits That Make Cooking So Much Easier.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, 14 Mar. 2024, https://www.buzzfeed.com/mariaelenagarcia/tiny-kitchen-habits.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- The author is a person, so the first author name is inverted, and the first name is written in full.<br />
- The page title is in quotation marks because it is a web page, not a standalone book.<br />
- <em>BuzzFeed</em> is italicized as the website container.<br />
- The date is written Day Month Year, which matches MLA style.<br />
- The URL points directly to the page.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If the page lists a nickname or handle, look for the full name in the byline area. If BuzzFeed only provides a handle and no full name, treat it cautiously. If you cannot confirm a full name, it may be better to treat it as no author and start with the title.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-on-a-buzzfeed-news-style-piece">Example 2, Two authors on a BuzzFeed News style piece</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Lee, Samantha Rose, and Jordan Michael Brown. “What the New Policy Means for Student Loan Borrowers.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, 2 Sept. 2023, https://www.buzzfeed.com/samantharoselee/student-loan-policy-explainer.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- Two authors means you list both.<br />
- The first author is inverted, the second is not inverted, and you use “and” between names, following your rule.<br />
- Full first names are used, not initials, which helps readers identify the writers accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Do not invert the second author. “Brown, Jordan Michael” would be incorrect in MLA for a two author entry.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-shown-quiz-page">Example 3, No author shown, quiz page</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
“Build a Sandwich and We Will Guess Your Age.” <em>BuzzFeed</em>, 6 July 2022, https://www.buzzfeed.com/buildasandwich/guess-your-age.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- No author is listed, so the entry begins with the title.<br />
- The title is in quotation marks because it is a page on a website.<br />
- <em>BuzzFeed</em> remains the container.<br />
- The date and URL help readers locate the exact quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you want to reference your quiz result, describe it in your sentence, for example, “When I completed the quiz, the result categorized me as a late 20s eater,” and cite the quiz page, not a personalized result link.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-for-buzzfeed-sources">
<h2 >Why these rules matter for BuzzFeed sources</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credibility and accountability:</strong> BuzzFeed mixes personal authorship, staff bylines, and corporate labels. Correct author handling makes it clear who is responsible for the content.</li>
<li><strong>Retrievability:</strong> BuzzFeed pages can be updated, redesigned, or republished. Including the right date and a stable URL helps readers find the version you used.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency in Works Cited:</strong> Inverting only the first author, using “and” for two authors, and using “et al.” for three or more authors keeps your list clean and easy to scan.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding accidental misinformation:</strong> Guessing at an author’s full name or citing a personalized quiz result page can mislead readers or make your source impossible to verify.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-checklist-practical-tips-and-common-pitfalls">
<h2 >Quick checklist, practical tips and common pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>full first name</strong> as displayed, do not use initials.</li>
<li>Invert <strong>only the first author</strong> in Works Cited.</li>
<li>For <strong>two authors</strong>, use “and,” and do not invert the second author.</li>
<li>For <strong>three or more authors</strong>, use the first author plus <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>no author</strong>, start with the <strong>title</strong>, not “BuzzFeed.”</li>
<li>Prefer the <strong>main quiz or article page</strong>, not a personalized or session based results page.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>date shown</strong>, and consider adding an <strong>access date</strong> if the content is likely to change.</li>
<li>Keep the container clear, usually <em>BuzzFeed</em>, and do not mix it with another platform unless you are citing that platform directly.</li>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-buzzfeed-article-in-mla-9">How do I cite a BuzzFeed article in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite a standard BuzzFeed news or culture article in MLA 9, start with the author’s name, then the article title in quotation marks. Next list the website name, BuzzFeed, in italics, followed by the publisher (often omitted if it is the same as the site name), the publication date, and the URL. End with an access date only if your instructor requests it or if the content is likely to change. Practical scenario, you are citing a reported BuzzFeed News piece with a clear author and date. Your Works Cited entry should look like: Lastname, Firstname. “Title of Article.” BuzzFeed, Day Month Year, URL. In your paper, use a parenthetical citation with the author’s last name. For MLA basics and examples, see Purdue OWL’s MLA Works Cited guidance: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_basic_format.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-buzzfeed-post-when-there-is-no-author-listed">How do I cite a BuzzFeed post when there is no author listed?</h3>
<p>If a BuzzFeed page does not list an author, MLA 9 lets you begin the Works Cited entry with the title of the page in quotation marks. Then include the site name, BuzzFeed, the publication date if available, and the URL. Practical scenario, you are using a BuzzFeed listicle that only shows a title and date, or a staff credit that does not function like a personal author. In your in text citation, shorten the title and put it in quotation marks, for example, (“Shortened Title”). If the page has a group author like “BuzzFeed Staff,” you can treat that as the author, but only if it is clearly presented as the creator. When dates are missing, omit the date rather than guessing. For help with no author situations in MLA, see MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/citing-works-without-an-author/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-buzzfeed-quiz-or-listicle-in-mla-9-including-the-results-i-got">How do I cite a BuzzFeed quiz or listicle in MLA 9 (including the results I got)?</h3>
<p>Cite a BuzzFeed quiz or listicle like a web page, using the author if listed, the title in quotation marks, the site name in italics, the date, and the URL. Practical scenario, you took a quiz and want to mention your outcome, such as a character match or score. You still cite the quiz page itself, not your personalized result screen, unless the result has its own stable URL and title. In your writing, you can describe your result in the sentence, then cite the quiz in parentheses. If the quiz content can change, an access date can be helpful. Example structure: Lastname, Firstname. “Quiz Title.” BuzzFeed, Day Month Year, URL. For guidance on citing web pages and when to use access dates, see MLA Style Center on dates: https://style.mla.org/using-access-dates/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-buzzfeed-video-in-mla-9-on-the-site-youtube-or-social-media">How do I cite a BuzzFeed video in MLA 9 (on the site, YouTube, or social media)?</h3>
<p>First identify where you watched the BuzzFeed video, because the container changes. If you watched it on YouTube, cite it as a YouTube video with the channel name, the title, the platform, the date, and the URL. If you watched it on BuzzFeed.com, cite it as a web page, and include a description like Video if needed for clarity. Practical scenario, you embed or reference a Tasty recipe video that appears on BuzzFeed and also on YouTube. Cite the version you actually used, since URLs and upload dates can differ. In text, cite the creator or channel name. MLA rules for videos vary by platform, so consult a reliable guide for the specific container. Purdue OWL’s MLA guidance on audiovisual works is a helpful starting point: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_other_common_sources.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-buzzfeed-news-investigation-or-longform-piece-that-has-multiple-authors">How do I cite a BuzzFeed News investigation or longform piece that has multiple authors?</h3>
<p>For a BuzzFeed News investigation with two authors, list both in the Works Cited entry in the order shown on the article. For three or more authors, list the first author followed by et al. Then include the article title in quotation marks, the site name in italics, the publication date, and the URL. Practical scenario, you are citing a collaborative investigation with several reporters and editors credited. In MLA 9, you generally follow the byline for authorship, and you do not need to list editors unless they are presented as the main creators. In text, use the first author’s last name followed by et al. if there are three or more. For MLA rules on multiple authors and et al., see MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/citing-a-work-by-multiple-authors/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-an-access-date-for-buzzfeed-citations-and-what-if-the-page-gets-updated-or-removed">Do I need an access date for BuzzFeed citations, and what if the page gets updated or removed?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but they are useful when content is likely to change, when no publication date is given, or when you suspect the page may be updated or deleted. Practical scenario, you cite a BuzzFeed list that gets revised, or a page that later returns an error. If the page shows an updated date, you can cite the date that is most relevant, usually the publication date, and mention in your text that the page was updated if that matters to your argument. If the page disappears, consider using a web archive link, and cite the archived version as the source you consulted. You can also keep a PDF or screenshot for your records. For MLA guidance on access dates, see https://style.mla.org/using-access-dates/ and for archived pages, see https://style.mla.org/citing-materials-from-online-archives/</p>
