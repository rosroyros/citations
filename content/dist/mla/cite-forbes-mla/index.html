<h2 >What “Forbes” means in an MLA 9 citation</h2>
<p>Forbes is usually a <strong>website</strong> and many Forbes pieces are <strong>online magazine articles</strong>. In MLA 9th edition, you cite a Forbes article the same way you cite most web articles, by identifying the key elements in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Author</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of the article</strong> in quotation marks</li>
<li><strong>Title of the website</strong> in italics (Forbes)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> (often omitted for websites when it is the same as the site title, which is common for Forbes)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong></li>
<li><strong>URL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong> (optional in MLA 9, but often useful for web sources that change)</li>
</ol>
<p>MLA is built around helping readers locate the source quickly and consistently. Forbes citations follow the same logic.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="core-works-cited-format-for-a-forbes-article-mla-9">
<h2 >Core Works Cited format for a Forbes article (MLA 9)</h2>
<h3 id="standard-template">Standard template</h3>
<p><strong>Author Last Name, First Middle. “Title of Article.” <em>Forbes</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>If there is no day listed, use <strong>Month Year</strong>. If there is only a year, use <strong>Year</strong>. Use what the page provides.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-and-how-they-apply-to-forbes">
<h2 >Author rules you must follow (and how they apply to Forbes)</h2>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>You specified that author names must use full first names, not initials. That means if the byline shows initials or a shortened name, you should try to confirm the full name (often by clicking the author profile page). Using full first names improves clarity and helps distinguish between authors with similar last names.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-inverted">First author inverted</h3>
<p>The first author is always inverted in Works Cited entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> Roberts, Monica.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Monica Roberts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This inversion supports alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors, use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p>For two authors, include both names, connect them with <strong>and</strong>, and do not invert the second author:</p>
<p><strong>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</strong></p>
<p>This keeps the entry readable while still sorting correctly by the first author.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">Three or more authors, use “et al.” after the first author only</h3>
<p>For three or more authors, list only the first author (inverted), then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the other authors.</p>
<p><strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<p>This prevents very long citations while still crediting the lead author and indicating additional contributors.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p>If there is no author listed, begin with the article title in quotation marks. Do not use “Anonymous” and do not insert “n.d.” Alphabetize by the first important word in the title, ignoring A, An, and The.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-urls-and-access-dates-for-forbes-pages">
<h2 >Dates, URLs, and access dates for Forbes pages</h2>
<h3 id="publication-date">Publication date</h3>
<p>Forbes articles usually show a date near the top. Use it exactly as MLA prefers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day Month Year</strong> (example: 14 May 2024)</li>
<li>If the site shows a timestamp, you still only need the date.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the page shows “Updated” information, MLA allows you to cite the version you used. A practical approach is to cite the date that is most clearly presented as the publication date. If the update date is more prominent and you used the updated version, use that date.</p>
<h3 id="url-formatting">URL formatting</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, you can include the URL without “https://” if your instructor allows, but it is also acceptable to keep it. The key is consistency. Do not add a period if it might confuse the link. Many writers still place a period at the end of the citation, but if you are worried about clarity, you can end with the URL and no punctuation.</p>
<h3 id="access-date-optional-but-useful">Access date (optional but useful)</h3>
<p>MLA 9 says access dates are optional, but they are still helpful for web pages that can change, move, or update. Forbes articles sometimes change headlines, add editors’ notes, or adjust content behind paywalls. Adding an access date can protect you if a reader sees a slightly different version later.</p>
<p>Format:</p>
<p><strong>Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-correctly">Why this is formatted correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author is first and inverted:</strong> Nguyen, Alina Marie.</li>
<li><strong>Article title is in quotation marks:</strong> “How Small Businesses Can Prepare for Higher Interest Rates.”</li>
<li><strong>Website title is italicized:</strong> <em>Forbes</em></li>
<li><strong>Date is in MLA order:</strong> 18 June 2024, not June 18, 2024</li>
<li><strong>URL is included:</strong> This is essential for online magazine articles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>On Forbes, the author’s name often appears as a hyperlink to a profile page. If the byline looks abbreviated, check the profile for the full first name and middle name. Your rule requires full first names, so that extra click can prevent an incomplete author entry.</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-correctly">Why this is formatted correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First author inverted:</strong> Patel, Rohan Deepak</li>
<li><strong>Second author not inverted:</strong> Simone Elise Carter</li>
<li><strong>“and” connects the authors:</strong> MLA uses “and,” not an ampersand.</li>
<li><strong>Date and site formatting follow MLA:</strong> Article title in quotes, <em>Forbes</em> italicized, date in day month year style.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall-to-avoid">Common pitfall to avoid</h3>
<p>Do not invert the second author. A frequent mistake is writing “Patel, Rohan Deepak, and Carter, Simone Elise.” MLA does not do that for two-author Works Cited entries.</p>

<h2 >Example 3, No author listed (with explanation)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry">Works Cited entry</h3>
<p>“Best Travel Insurance Companies of 2024.” <em>Forbes</em>, 22 Apr. 2024, https://www.forbes.com/advisor/travel-insurance/best-travel-insurance/.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-correctly">Why this is formatted correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author, so the title comes first:</strong> “Best Travel Insurance Companies of 2024.”</li>
<li><strong>Title is in quotation marks:</strong> It is a web article, not a standalone book.</li>
<li><strong>Website title is italicized:</strong> <em>Forbes</em></li>
<li><strong>No “Anonymous” and no “n.d.”:</strong> MLA prefers using the information that is actually present.</li>
<li><strong>URL points directly to the page:</strong> This helps the reader find the exact item.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>When there is no author, double-check that the author is not listed near the bottom of the page, in a sidebar, or under an “Editorial” label. Forbes Advisor pages, for example, sometimes list contributors and editors in less obvious places. If you find a real author, use that instead of starting with the title.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-find-your-source-fast">They help readers find your source fast</h3>
<p>MLA citations are not just formalities. They are a map. When your author name, title, date, and URL are in the expected places, a reader can locate the exact Forbes page in seconds.</p>
<h3 id="they-support-fairness-and-accuracy-in-credit">They support fairness and accuracy in credit</h3>
<p>Using full first names and correctly handling multiple authors reduces confusion and gives proper credit. This matters in academic work because attribution is part of ethical writing.</p>
<h3 id="they-keep-your-works-cited-list-consistent">They keep your Works Cited list consistent</h3>
<p>Consistency is a major reason MLA uses standard ordering and punctuation. A consistent Works Cited page is easier to scan, easier to grade, and easier for you to manage when you have many sources.</p>

<h3 id="pitfall-1-treating-forbes-like-a-print-magazine-automatically">Pitfall 1, Treating Forbes like a print magazine automatically</h3>
<p>Forbes has a print magazine, but most students use web pages. If you accessed the article online, cite it as a web article with a URL. Only cite the print version if you actually used the print issue.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-2-using-initials-when-the-full-name-is-available">Pitfall 2, Using initials when the full name is available</h3>
<p>Your rule requires full first names. If the byline is abbreviated, use the author profile page to confirm the full name.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-3-misplacing-italics-and-quotation-marks">Pitfall 3, Misplacing italics and quotation marks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Article title: in “quotation marks”</li>
<li>Website title: in <em>italics</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Switching these is one of the most common MLA formatting errors.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-4-missing-the-date-or-formatting-it-incorrectly">Pitfall 4, Missing the date or formatting it incorrectly</h3>
<p>MLA uses <strong>day month year</strong>. Also, MLA abbreviates some months in citations (for example, Apr., Sept.). If you use abbreviations, use them consistently.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-5-listing-all-authors-for-long-bylines">Pitfall 5, Listing all authors for long bylines</h3>
<p>For three or more authors, your rule is clear. Use the first author and then <strong>et al.</strong> This keeps citations clean and MLA-compliant.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Forbes citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-forbes-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes Forbes citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Forbes is a single publication name, but it hosts many different kinds of content. Some items look like magazine articles, others look like blog posts, contributor columns, press release style pieces, lists, and pages that update over time. MLA 9 is flexible, but that flexibility creates edge cases where you must decide what the “source” really is, and which details are stable enough to cite.</p>
<p>The goal of MLA rules is consistency and traceability. A reader should be able to find the exact Forbes page you used, even if Forbes updates the page layout, adds ads, or changes navigation. When you handle special cases correctly, your Works Cited entry becomes a reliable map to your source.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-pattern-for-a-typical-forbes-web-article">
<h2 >Core pattern for a typical Forbes web article</h2>
<p>Most Forbes items you cite for school writing are web pages. A standard MLA 9 Works Cited entry for a Forbes web article usually follows this order:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Article.” <em>Forbes</em>, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Important points that often matter for Forbes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forbes often has contributor bylines, not staff writers. You still treat the byline as the author.</li>
<li>Forbes sometimes shows an “Updated” timestamp. If the page clearly lists an update date that reflects the version you used, you can cite the update date. If it shows both published and updated, choose the date most relevant to what you are quoting or relying on, usually the updated date if the content changed.</li>
<li>If the page has no clear date, you can omit the date. Do not insert “n.d.” in MLA.</li>
<li>URLs on Forbes can be long. MLA allows you to shorten URLs by removing tracking parameters, as long as the link still works.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-contributor-pages-and-staff-labels">
<h2 >Special case 1, Contributor pages and “staff” labels</h2>
<h3 id="the-edge-case">The edge case</h3>
<p>Forbes content is often written by contributors, and the byline can be displayed in different ways, for example “Jane Doe,” “Jane Doe, Contributor,” or “Forbes Staff.” Sometimes the byline area is inconsistent across devices or page versions.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-handle-it">How to handle it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the name exactly as the author, but do not include role labels like “Contributor” in the author field.</li>
<li>If the author is listed as “Forbes Staff,” treat “Forbes Staff” as the author name. It is a group author.</li>
<li>If there is no author line at all, treat it as “no author” and start with the title.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>The author element is what MLA uses to alphabetize and to connect in text citations to the Works Cited. If you incorrectly include “Contributor” as part of the name, you can create a mismatch between your in text citation and your Works Cited entry, and you make the author harder to identify.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-no-author-visible-or-author-hidden-behind-page-elements">
<h2 >Special case 2, No author visible, or author hidden behind page elements</h2>
<h3 id="the-edge-case">The edge case</h3>
<p>Sometimes Forbes pages appear without an author due to a paywall prompt, a print view, a mobile view, or a republished piece where the byline is not obvious.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-handle-it">How to handle it</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you cannot confirm an author from the page itself, do not guess.</li>
<li>Start the Works Cited entry with the title of the page in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Alphabetize by the first significant word in the title, ignoring A, An, and The.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>MLA prioritizes accuracy over completeness. Guessing an author can misattribute work and weaken your credibility. Starting with the title is the correct MLA solution for truly authorless pages.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-multiple-authors-on-forbes">
<h2 >Special case 3, Multiple authors on Forbes</h2>
<h3 id="the-edge-case">The edge case</h3>
<p>Some Forbes items, especially reporting, investigations, or collaborative pieces, list two or more authors.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-handle-it-using-your-rules">How to handle it using your rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> Invert the first author only, then use “and” plus the second author in normal order.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors:</strong> List only the first author, inverted, then add “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>This keeps Works Cited entries consistent and readable. It also prevents long author lists from overwhelming the citation while still crediting the main author and signaling collaboration.</p>

<h2 >Special case 4, Dates, updated pages, and “last modified”</h2>
<h3 id="the-edge-case">The edge case</h3>
<p>Forbes frequently updates list articles, rankings, and finance related pages. You might see “Updated” or a time stamp, or you might see a date that changes between visits.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-handle-it">How to handle it</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the page clearly states an update date and your argument relies on the current version, cite the update date.</li>
<li>If you are quoting something that may change, add an <strong>Accessed</strong> date. This is especially helpful for Forbes lists and rankings.</li>
<li>If no date is shown, omit the date and include an Accessed date.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>For changing pages, your Accessed date helps your reader understand which version you used. This is essential when Forbes content is dynamic.</p>

<h2 >Special case 5, Forbes lists, rankings, and pages that function like databases</h2>
<h3 id="the-edge-case">The edge case</h3>
<p>Pages like “The World’s Billionaires,” “30 Under 30,” or company profile pages can behave more like living database entries than fixed articles.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-handle-it">How to handle it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Treat the page as a web page, but be extra careful to include an Accessed date.</li>
<li>If the page has a clear year or edition name in the title, include it as part of the title.</li>
<li>If the page is part of a larger list series, you can cite the specific page you used rather than the entire project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>Rankings can change, and even the ordering of entries can shift. A precise title and an Accessed date make your citation verifiable.</p>

<li>Use the cleanest working URL. Remove tracking parameters such as <code>?sh=</code> if the page still loads.</li>
<li>Prefer the canonical page URL shown in the address bar after the page finishes redirecting.</li>
<li>If a URL is extremely long, you may shorten it, but do not remove essential path elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>A clean URL increases the chance that your reader can reach the same page. MLA cares about retrievability, not about preserving marketing parameters.</p>

<h2 >Examples with explanations (formatted to your rules)</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-one-author-typical-forbes-web-article">Example 1, One author, typical Forbes web article</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Henderson, Alicia Marie. “How Small Businesses Can Prepare for a Recession.” <em>Forbes</em>, 12 Oct. 2023, https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciamariehenderson/how-small-businesses-can-prepare-for-a-recession/. Accessed 5 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- The author uses a full first name, and the first author is inverted: Henderson, Alicia Marie.<br />
- The article title is in quotation marks because it is a web page, not a standalone work.<br />
- <em>Forbes</em> is italicized as the container.<br />
- The date is written Day Month Year in MLA style.<br />
- The Accessed date is included because Forbes pages can be updated or reformatted.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Including “Contributor” after the author name. MLA does not treat role labels as part of the author element.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-first-inverted-second-normal-order">Example 2, Two authors (first inverted, second normal order)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Ruiz, Daniel Thomas, and Priya Nandini Shah. “Inside the New Race for AI Chips.” <em>Forbes</em>, 8 May 2024, https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielthomasruiz/inside-the-new-race-for-ai-chips/. Accessed 5 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- Two authors are joined by “and.”<br />
- Only the first author is inverted, the second author remains in normal order.<br />
- Full first names are used, not initials, to match your rule set and to keep author identity clear.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Inverting both authors. In MLA, only the first author is inverted in the Works Cited entry.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-shown-start-with-title">Example 3, No author shown, start with title</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
“Best Travel Credit Cards of 2025.” <em>Forbes</em>, 2025, https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/best-travel-credit-cards/. Accessed 5 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- No author is listed, so the entry begins with the title.<br />
- The title is in quotation marks because it is a page within the <em>Forbes</em> site.<br />
- The Accessed date is important because recommendation pages and rankings can change.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Using “Anonymous” or “n.d.” MLA does not use those placeholders. If there is no author or no date, you omit that element and strengthen the citation with what you do have, often the Accessed date.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls for Forbes citations</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copy the author name carefully.</strong> Forbes contributor names can include middle names. Use the full first name, and include the middle name if shown.</li>
<li><strong>Check for an update date.</strong> If the page says “Updated” and your information depends on the updated version, cite that date.</li>
<li><strong>Always consider an Accessed date for Forbes.</strong> It is especially helpful for lists, finance, and advice pages.</li>
<li><strong>Use the page title as your anchor.</strong> Forbes URLs can change, but the title usually stays recognizable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitfalls-to-avoid">Pitfalls to avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not treat “Forbes” as the author</strong> unless the page truly lists a group author like “Forbes Staff.”</li>
<li><strong>Do not add role labels into the author field,</strong> such as “Contributor” or “Senior Editor.”</li>
<li><strong>Do not use initials for first names</strong> in the Works Cited entry under your required rules.</li>
<li><strong>Do not cite the homepage</strong> when you used a specific article. Cite the exact page you read.</li>

<h2 >Final checklist for Forbes edge cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a clear author? If not, start with the title.</li>
<li>Is the first author inverted, and are full first names used?</li>
<li>If there are two authors, did you invert only the first and use “and”?</li>
<li>If there are three or more authors, did you use “et al.” after the first author only?</li>
<li>Did you include the most relevant date, and add an Accessed date when the page is likely to change?</li>
<li>Is the URL clean and functional?</li>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-forbes-article-in-mla-9-works-cited-and-in-text">How do I cite a Forbes article in MLA 9 (works cited and in-text)?</h3>
<p>To cite a Forbes article in MLA 9, start with the author’s name, then the article title in quotation marks, the site name (Forbes) in italics, the publisher (often omitted for websites, but Forbes can be treated as the website name), the publication date, the URL, and an access date if needed. Example structure: Lastname, Firstname. “Title of Article.” Forbes, Day Month Year, URL. In text, use the author’s last name in parentheses, like (Smith). If there is no author, use a shortened title in quotation marks, like (“Title of Article”). Practical scenario: if you quote a statistic about market growth, include the in-text citation right after the quote and list the full entry in Works Cited. For MLA guidance, see the MLA Works Cited basics at https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and MLA in-text citations at https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-forbes-article-has-no-author-listed-how-do-i-cite-it-in-mla">What if the Forbes article has no author listed, how do I cite it in MLA?</h3>
<p>If a Forbes page does not list an author, begin the Works Cited entry with the article title in quotation marks. Then list Forbes in italics, followed by the publication date (if available), the URL, and an access date if the content is likely to change or if the date is missing. In-text, cite a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, for example (“AI in Retail”). Practical scenario: you are citing an unsigned Forbes staff roundup or a brief news update. In that case, do not invent an author, and do not use “Anonymous” unless the page explicitly says that. If the page lists an organization like “Forbes Staff,” you can treat that as the author. For more on missing authors and how to start entries, consult MLA guidance on core elements at https://style.mla.org/mla-style-center/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-forbes-contributors-page-like-a-columnist-or-a-guest-writer-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Forbes contributors page, like a columnist or a guest writer, in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Forbes often labels writers as “Contributors,” but in MLA you still cite the person named on the article as the author. Your Works Cited entry should begin with the contributor’s name, followed by the article title, Forbes in italics, the date, and the URL. Practical scenario: you are using an opinion piece by a Forbes contributor in a business ethics paper. You can cite it the same way you would cite any authored web article, but you should be careful to describe it accurately in your writing as commentary or analysis, not a peer reviewed study. In-text citations use the last name, like (Lopez). If the contributor has a profile page you also consulted, cite that separately as a web page, especially if you quote bio details. See MLA web source formatting examples at https://style.mla.org/websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-forbes-video-or-podcast-episode-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Forbes video or podcast episode in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite a Forbes video or podcast, identify the container and the key contributors. In MLA, you typically start with the title of the episode or video in quotation marks. Then list the container, such as Forbes, in italics, the publisher if relevant, the date, and the URL. If a host, interviewer, or director is important to your use, include that role after the title, for example, “Interview with Name,” or “Hosted by Name.” Practical scenario: you cite a Forbes interview clip where a CEO explains a strategy. Quote the timestamped portion in your notes, then cite the video with its URL. In text, use a shortened title if no author is clear. For detailed MLA audiovisual rules, consult https://style.mla.org/citing-audio-visual-materials/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-include-an-access-date-when-citing-forbes-and-when-is-it-required-in-mla-9">Should I include an access date when citing Forbes, and when is it required in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but they are recommended when a source is likely to change, when the publication date is missing, or when you are using a dynamic page that updates. Forbes pages can be edited, and some pages show update timestamps or change formatting over time. Practical scenario: you cite a Forbes list, ranking, or live updating page where numbers may shift. Including “Accessed Day Month Year” helps document what you saw. If the article has a clear publication date and is stable, you can omit the access date unless your instructor requires it. Also, if you accessed the page through a database or app that changes URLs, note the access date to support retrieval. See MLA guidance on access dates and optional elements at https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-forbes-article-i-found-through-google-news-or-a-paywall-and-the-url-is-messy">How do I cite a Forbes article I found through Google News or a paywall, and the URL is messy?</h3>
<p>If you read a Forbes article through an aggregator like Google News, or you hit a paywall, cite the version you actually used, but prioritize a stable, direct Forbes URL when possible. In your Works Cited entry, include the author, title, Forbes in italics, date, and the cleanest URL you can locate, often by opening the article directly on Forbes and copying the canonical link. Practical scenario: your browser shows a long tracking link from Google. Replace it with the Forbes link that loads the same article, since MLA prefers the most direct URL. If you accessed the article via a library database, cite the database as a second container if required by your instructor, and include the database URL or DOI if available. For MLA rules on containers and URLs, see https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
