<section class="content-section" id="what-a-medium-citation-looks-like-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What a Medium citation looks like in MLA 9</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a Medium post is usually treated like a work on a website. Medium is the container (the website), and the specific post is the source you are citing. Your goal is to help readers quickly identify who wrote the post, what it is called, where it appears, when it was published, and how to find it again.</p>
<p>A typical MLA 9 Works Cited entry for a Medium post follows this pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Post." <em>Medium</em>, Publication date, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Not every Medium post will have every element, but MLA’s order stays consistent. You include what you can find, and you do not invent missing information.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-elements-and-the-correct-order">
<h2 >Core elements and the correct order</h2>
<h3 id="1-author-with-your-required-name-rules">1) Author (with your required name rules)</h3>
<p>MLA 9 normally uses whatever name appears on the source, but you specified stricter rules for names. Apply them consistently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use full first names, not initials.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invert the first author’s name</strong>: Last, First Middle.</li>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: first author inverted, second author normal order, joined by <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: first author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: start with the title.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Works Cited entries are alphabetized. Inverting the first author’s name makes that sorting clear and consistent. Using full first names helps avoid confusion when multiple writers share a last name or initials.</p>
<h3 id="2-title-of-the-post-in-quotation-marks">2) Title of the post (in quotation marks)</h3>
<p>Medium posts are usually individual articles, so treat them as short works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the post title in <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li>Capitalize in <strong>title case</strong> (capitalize major words).</li>
<li>End the title with a period inside the quotation marks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Quotation marks signal that you are citing one piece within a larger site, not the entire Medium platform.</p>
<h3 id="3-title-of-the-website-in-italics">3) Title of the website (in italics)</h3>
<p>Use <em>Medium</em> as the website name in most cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Italicize <em>Medium</em>.</li>
<li>Follow with a comma.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: The container tells readers where the post is hosted. This is especially important because Medium content is sometimes reposted elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="4-publication-date">4) Publication date</h3>
<p>Use the date shown on the post.</p>
<ul>
<li>MLA prefers: <strong>Day Month Year</strong> (for example, 14 Feb. 2024).</li>
<li>Medium sometimes shows only month and year, or it may show an updated date. Use the date that is clearly labeled as the publication date. If only an updated date is available, you can still use it, but be consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Online writing can change. The date helps readers locate the version you used and understand its timeliness.</p>
<h3 id="5-url-without-https-if-you-want-but-be-consistent">5) URL (without https:// if you want, but be consistent)</h3>
<p>Include the direct link to the post.</p>
<ul>
<li>MLA 9 allows you to omit https://, but it is also acceptable to keep it. Pick one approach and apply it across your Works Cited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: The URL is the fastest path back to the exact source.</p>
<h3 id="6-access-date-often-useful-for-medium">6) Access date (often useful for Medium)</h3>
<p>MLA 9 says access dates are optional, but they are recommended when content is likely to change, or when a date is missing or unclear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Format: <strong>Accessed 3 Jan. 2026.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Medium posts can be edited after publication. An access date documents when you viewed the content.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-correct-formatting-and-detailed-explanations">
<h2 >Examples with correct formatting and detailed explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-one-author-standard-medium-post">Example 1, One author (standard Medium post)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Nguyen, Hannah Marie. "How to Build a Reading Habit That Sticks." <em>Medium</em>, 14 Feb. 2024, https://medium.com/example/how-to-build-a-reading-habit-that-sticks-1234567890. Accessed 3 Jan. 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why each part is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Nguyen, Hannah Marie.</strong> The author is listed first, and the first author’s name is inverted for alphabetizing. Full first name is used, not initials.<br />
- <strong>"How to Build a Reading Habit That Sticks."</strong> The post title is in quotation marks because it is an article, not an entire website.<br />
- ** <em>Medium</em>,<strong> The website name is italicized as the container.<br />
- </strong>14 Feb. 2024,<strong> The publication date is in day month year format.<br />
- </strong>URL<strong> gives a direct path to the post.<br />
- </strong>Accessed 3 Jan. 2026.** This documents when you consulted the page.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not italicize the post title. Italics are for the container, which is <em>Medium</em>.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-follow-your-and-rule">Example 2, Two authors (follow your “and” rule)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Patel, Riya Anika, and Jordan Michael Lee. "Designing Better Morning Routines with Behavioral Science." <em>Medium</em>, 6 Sept. 2023, https://medium.com/example/designing-better-morning-routines-abcdef1234. Accessed 3 Jan. 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Patel, Riya Anika, and Jordan Michael Lee.</strong> The first author is inverted. The second author is not inverted and is introduced with <strong>and</strong>, which is MLA standard and matches your rule.<br />
- Everything after the authors follows the same order as the one author example.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not invert the second author’s name. Writing “Lee, Jordan Michael” would be incorrect for a two author MLA entry.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-listed-start-with-the-title">Example 3, No author listed (start with the title)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>"A Practical Guide to Note Taking for Online Classes." <em>Medium</em>, 10 Jan. 2022, https://medium.com/example/a-practical-guide-to-note-taking-for-online-classes-9876543210. Accessed 3 Jan. 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- There is <strong>no author</strong>, so the entry begins with the <strong>title</strong> in quotation marks.<br />
- For alphabetizing, you ignore initial articles like <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, and <strong>The</strong>, but you still keep them in the title as written.<br />
- You do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” You simply omit what is missing and include what you can verify.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not put the website name first when there is no author. The title should lead.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter in real academic writing</h2>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-verify-your-evidence">They help readers verify your evidence</h3>
<p>Medium content can be edited, reposted, or removed. Clear citations make it easier for a reader, instructor, or peer reviewer to find what you used and evaluate it.</p>
<h3 id="they-prevent-confusion-between-similar-sources">They prevent confusion between similar sources</h3>
<p>Many Medium posts have similar titles, and many writers use similar usernames. Full first names and correct ordering reduce ambiguity, especially when multiple sources share a last name.</p>
<h3 id="they-keep-your-works-cited-consistent-and-professional">They keep your Works Cited consistent and professional</h3>
<p>MLA style is partly about readability. When every entry follows the same order and punctuation, your Works Cited becomes easy to scan, and readers can quickly locate authors, dates, and links.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips for citing Medium correctly</h2>
<h3 id="use-the-name-shown-on-the-post-but-apply-your-full-name-rule-carefully">Use the name shown on the post, but apply your full name rule carefully</h3>
<p>Medium sometimes displays a full name, sometimes a handle. If a post lists only a handle and no real name is visible, MLA would normally let you use that handle as the author name as it appears. Under your rules, you should still avoid initials, but you also should not invent a full first name. If only a handle is available, use the handle as written.</p>
<h3 id="prefer-stable-urls">Prefer stable URLs</h3>
<p>Medium links can include tracking parameters. If possible, use the cleanest version of the URL that still works. Remove obvious tracking strings when you are confident the link remains functional.</p>
<h3 id="keep-date-formatting-consistent">Keep date formatting consistent</h3>
<p>Use day month year across your Works Cited. If Medium shows “Sep 6, 2023,” convert it to <strong>6 Sept. 2023</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="consider-including-an-access-date-most-of-the-time">Consider including an access date most of the time</h3>
<p>Because Medium posts can change, an access date is a practical safeguard, especially for assignments that require online sources.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials for authors</strong> when the full first name is available. Your rule requires full first names.</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author</strong> in a two author citation. Only the first author is inverted.</li>
<li><strong>Listing all authors</strong> when there are three or more. Use the first author only, then <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Italicizing the article title</strong> instead of placing it in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the container</strong>. <em>Medium</em> should usually appear in italics after the post title.</li>
<li><strong>Using “n.d.”</strong> for missing dates. MLA 9 generally omits unknown elements rather than inserting placeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving out the URL</strong>. For online sources like Medium, the URL is a key retrieval tool.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Medium citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-medium-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes Medium citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Medium is not just one kind of source. A Medium page can function like a magazine article, a blog post, a newsletter issue, or a reprint of writing first published somewhere else. Medium also supports multiple publication contexts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium.com</strong> as the host site.</li>
<li><strong>Publications</strong> within Medium, such as <em>Better Programming</em> or <em>Human Parts</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Member-only pages</strong> that some readers cannot access.</li>
<li><strong>Posts that are later updated</strong>, which creates date confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Posts that are cross-posted or imported</strong> from another platform, which affects what you should treat as the “original” source.</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA 9 is flexible, but you still need consistent choices. The special cases below help you decide what to record and in what order.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-template-for-a-medium-post">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 template for a Medium post</h2>
<p>In most situations, cite a Medium post like a web article.</p>
<p><strong>Basic pattern:</strong></p>
<p>Author. “Title of Post.” <em>Title of Website</em>, Publisher (if different), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<p><strong>How this usually maps to Medium:</strong><br />
- <strong>Author</strong>: The person who wrote the post.<br />
- <strong>Title of Post</strong>: The post title in quotation marks.<br />
- <strong>Title of Website</strong>: Usually <em>Medium</em>.<br />
- <strong>Publisher</strong>: Often omitted because Medium is both the site and publisher. If a specific organization clearly publishes the content and is distinct from the site, you can include it.<br />
- <strong>Date</strong>: Use the publication date shown on the post. Handle updates carefully, see the edge cases below.<br />
- <strong>URL</strong>: Use the stable URL for the post.<br />
- <strong>Accessed date</strong>: Optional in MLA 9, but recommended for Medium if the content is paywalled, updated, or likely to change.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-author-name-formatting-on-medium-profiles">
<h2 >Special case 1, Author name formatting on Medium profiles</h2>
<p>Medium authors sometimes display:<br />
- A username.<br />
- A shortened name.<br />
- A name with initials.<br />
- A brand name.</p>
<p>Your rule set requires <strong>full first names, not initials</strong>, and the <strong>first author must be inverted</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the name as it appears if it is already a full name.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the author uses initials but you can verify the full first name from a reliable place</strong>, such as the author’s official website, LinkedIn, or a clearly matching profile, use the full name. This improves clarity and aligns with your guide’s principle of respecting identity.</li>
<li><strong>If you cannot confirm the full first name</strong>, do not guess. In that case, treat it as presented, or consider the “no author” approach if the attribution is unclear.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>MLA Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element. Inverting the first author’s name, for example “Nguyen, Hannah,” ensures consistent sorting and helps readers quickly locate sources.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-two-authors-and-three-or-more-authors-on-medium">
<h2 >Special case 2, Two authors and three or more authors on Medium</h2>
<p>Medium posts can have multiple authors, especially in publications or collaborative essays.</p>
<h3 id="apply-your-rules">Apply your rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: First author inverted, second author normal order, use <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: First author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong> only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>This prevents inconsistent author lists and keeps citations readable. It also ensures your Works Cited list stays easy to scan.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-no-author-on-medium">
<h2 >Special case 3, No author on Medium</h2>
<p>Some Medium pages are attributed to:<br />
- A publication name only.<br />
- A corporate account.<br />
- No clear author at all.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>If there is <strong>no author</strong>, start with the <strong>title of the post</strong> in quotation marks. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Starting with the title is the MLA 9 default when author information is missing. It also keeps your citation honest, you are not inventing an author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-medium-publications-and-how-to-include-them">
<h2 >Special case 4, Medium “Publications” and how to include them</h2>
<p>Medium posts often appear “in” a Medium publication. This can confuse writers because there are two meaningful titles:<br />
- The <strong>post title</strong>.<br />
- The <strong>publication title</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="practical-approach">Practical approach</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, you can treat the publication name as part of the container information, but you should not let it replace the website container unless your instructor or style guide requires it.</p>
<p>Two common, acceptable options are:<br />
- Cite the container as <em>Medium</em> and mention the publication if it is important in your discussion.<br />
- If the publication clearly functions like the container for the piece, you can include it as an additional container element, but keep the citation clean and consistent across your paper.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Readers need to find the source quickly. Overloading the citation with multiple “containers” can make it harder to read. Under-including information can make it harder to locate, especially if the post is distributed through a publication page.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-reprints-and-cross-posts-on-medium">
<h2 >Special case 5, Reprints and cross-posts on Medium</h2>
<p>Many writers repost work on Medium that first appeared elsewhere. Medium sometimes labels this with notes like:<br />
- “Originally published at…”<br />
- “This post first appeared on…”<br />
- A canonical link in the page metadata.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you used the Medium version</strong>, cite the Medium version, because that is what your reader will likely click and what you actually consulted.</li>
<li><strong>If your argument depends on the original publication context</strong>, or if the Medium version is clearly a repost with changes, cite the <strong>original site</strong> instead, or cite both if you directly compare them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>MLA is about transparency. Your citation should match what you read and what your reader can verify. Cross-posting creates version differences, so choosing the correct version protects your credibility.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-6-updated-dates-versus-published-dates">
<h2 >Special case 6, Updated dates versus published dates</h2>
<p>Medium pages may show:<br />
- A published date.<br />
- An “Updated” indicator, sometimes without a clear updated date.<br />
- A date that changes if the author edits the post.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>publication date</strong> shown on the page.</li>
<li>If a clear <strong>updated date</strong> is provided and it matters to your use, you can include it in your notes or mention it in your text, but do not invent dates.</li>
<li>Add an <strong>Accessed</strong> date when updates are likely, or when the post is behind a paywall.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Dates help readers understand timing and version. For fast-changing web writing, an access date can function as a snapshot marker.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-7-paywalled-or-member-only-medium-posts">
<h2 >Special case 7, Paywalled or member-only Medium posts</h2>

<li>Keep the citation the same, but include an <strong>Accessed</strong> date to document when you viewed it.</li>
<li>If you used an archived or shared version, cite that version instead, but only if it is legitimate and stable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Access issues are common with Medium. An access date helps explain why a reader might not see the same page you saw.</p>

<h2 >Special case 8, URLs, tracking links, and clean formatting</h2>
<p>Medium links often include tracking parameters.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>cleanest stable URL</strong> you can.</li>
<li>Remove obvious tracking strings when possible, such as long query parameters after a question mark.</li>

<h2 >Examples with explanations (following your author rules)</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-single-author-standard-medium-post">Example 1, Single author, standard Medium post</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>Lopez, Mariana. “How I Built a Morning Routine That Actually Stuck.” <em>Medium</em>, 14 Mar. 2024, https://medium.com/@marianalopez/how-i-built-a-morning-routine-that-actually-stuck-1234567890ab. Accessed 20 May 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author name is <strong>inverted</strong> and uses a <strong>full first name</strong>, “Lopez, Mariana.”<br />
- The post title is in <strong>quotation marks</strong>.<br />
- <em>Medium</em> is italicized as the <strong>website container</strong>.<br />
- The date is in MLA format, day month year.<br />
- The URL is included, followed by an <strong>Accessed</strong> date because Medium posts can change or become restricted.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
- Writing the author as “M. Lopez” or “Mariana L.” violates your full first name rule and makes alphabetizing less clear.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-on-one-medium-post">Example 2, Two authors on one Medium post</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>Patel, Ayesha Rina, and Daniel Morgan. “Designing Accessible Data Visualizations for the Web.” <em>Medium</em>, 2 Feb. 2023, https://medium.com/design/accessible-data-visualizations-abcdef123456. Accessed 18 Apr. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- First author is inverted, “Patel, Ayesha Rina.”<br />
- Second author is <strong>not inverted</strong> and uses <strong>and</strong>, “and Daniel Morgan.”<br />
- Only two authors are listed because it is a two-author work.<br />
- The rest follows the standard Medium pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
- Inverting both authors, or using an ampersand, such as “Patel, Ayesha Rina, and Morgan, Daniel,” conflicts with your rule set.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-listed-on-the-page">Example 3, No author listed on the page</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>“Why Remote Teams Fail Without Documentation.” <em>Medium</em>, 9 Sept. 2022, https://medium.com/work/why-remote-teams-fail-without-documentation-9876543210fe. Accessed 3 Jan. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- With <strong>no author</strong>, the entry starts with the <strong>title</strong>.<br />
- No “Anonymous” is added, and no “n.d.” is used.<br />
- The title is still in quotation marks because it is a short work on a website.<br />
- The access date helps with a platform where visibility can change.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
- Starting with the publication name as if it were the author, when the page does not clearly identify an authoring organization.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls for Medium citations</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture the page details immediately</strong>, author name, title, date, and URL. Medium pages can change.</li>
<li><strong>Prefer an accessed date</strong> when you cite Medium. It is a simple way to handle updates, paywalls, and edits.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent about publication names</strong>. If you include Medium publication titles for one source, use the same approach for all Medium sources in the paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitfalls-to-avoid">Pitfalls to avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials</strong> for authors when the full first name is available, since your guide requires full first names.</li>
<li><strong>Guessing a full name</strong> when the author uses a handle and you cannot verify identity.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving in tracking-heavy URLs</strong>, which look messy and may break.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing versions</strong> of reposted work without noting it. Cite the version you actually used, unless your argument requires the original.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>These edge-case rules protect three things that MLA values:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traceability</strong>, the reader can find what you used.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>, your Works Cited list is easy to scan and alphabetize.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>, you do not invent missing information, and you do not cite a different version than the one you read.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want, paste one Medium link you are citing, and I will format it into a Works Cited entry using your exact author rules and the best approach for that specific page.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-medium-article-in-mla-9-if-there-is-an-author-and-a-publication-name">How do I cite a Medium article in MLA 9 if there is an author and a publication name?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, treat a Medium post like a web article. Start with the author’s name, then put the article title in quotation marks. Next, list the Medium publication name in italics if the story appears in a publication (for example, Better Programming). After that, list Medium in italics as the website, then the publication date, and the URL. Add an access date only if your instructor requires it or if the content is likely to change. Practical scenario, if you found an article written by Jane Doe in a Medium publication, your Works Cited entry will include both the publication and Medium, because they function like container 1 and container 2. For more guidance, see the MLA Works Cited core elements overview: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and the MLA web page template: https://style.mla.org/citing-a-website/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-medium-post-in-mla-9-when-there-is-no-author-name-listed">How do I cite a Medium post in MLA 9 when there is no author name listed?</h3>
<p>If a Medium post does not list a personal author, begin the Works Cited entry with the title of the post in quotation marks. Then list the publication name in italics if it is part of a Medium publication, followed by Medium in italics, the date, and the URL. In your in text citation, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, since there is no author to point to. Practical scenario, if the author line is missing but the article is clearly hosted on Medium, you still cite it as a web source, you just shift the title to the first position. If the page is a company or organization account with a clear name, you may use that as the author, but only if it is presented as the author on the page. MLA guidance on unknown authors is summarized here: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-date-should-i-use-when-citing-medium-published-date-updated-date-or-both">What date should I use when citing Medium, published date, updated date, or both?</h3>
<p>Use the date that best represents the version you consulted. If Medium shows a single publication date, cite that. If it shows an updated or last updated date and the update is meaningful, you can use the updated date, especially if the content changed substantially. MLA 9 generally uses one date in the Works Cited entry, so you usually do not list both. Practical scenario, you are citing a programming tutorial that was updated last month to reflect a new library version. Use the updated date if it is clearly labeled and you relied on the revised instructions. If there is no date at all, omit the date and consider adding an access date if your instructor wants it or if the page is likely to change. For MLA’s guidance on dates and optional access dates, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-a-website/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-an-in-text-citation-for-a-medium-article-in-mla-9">How do I do an in text citation for a Medium article in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, in text citations usually include the author’s last name and a page number, but web sources like Medium usually have no page numbers. If the Medium article has an author, cite the author’s last name in parentheses, for example (Doe). If there is no author, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, for example (“How to Train a Model”). Do not include the URL in the in text citation. Practical scenario, you quote a sentence from a Medium essay by Alex Nguyen. You can write, Nguyen argues that, then place (Nguyen) at the end of the sentence if you did not already name the author in the signal phrase. If you cite multiple works by the same author, add a shortened title to distinguish them. See MLA’s in text citation basics here: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations-the-basics/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-medium-story-that-is-behind-the-paywall-or-requires-a-medium-membership">How do I cite a Medium story that is behind the paywall or requires a Medium membership?</h3>
<p>Cite it like any other Medium article, author, title, publication if applicable, Medium, date, and URL. The paywall does not change the core citation format. If the URL resolves to a login page for some readers, still include the stable URL to the story, not a redirected sign in link. Practical scenario, you accessed the article through your membership and your classmate cannot open it. Your citation remains valid, but it can help to mention in your annotation or note to your instructor that the content is membership only, especially for assignments where access matters. If you saved a PDF or offline copy, you still cite the original Medium web page unless your instructor specifically asks you to cite the file you used. For MLA web citation guidance, see: https://style.mla.org/citing-a-website/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-medium-article-that-i-found-reposted-somewhere-else-or-cross-posted-from-a-personal-blog">How do I cite a Medium article that I found reposted somewhere else, or cross posted from a personal blog?</h3>
<p>Cite the version you actually used, and make sure your citation matches where you accessed it. If you read it on Medium, cite Medium as the website, even if the content also appears on the author’s blog. If the Medium post clearly states it was originally published elsewhere, you can mention the original in your discussion, but MLA citations usually focus on the source you consulted. Practical scenario, an author cross posts an essay from their Substack to Medium, and you used the Medium link because it was easier to access. Cite the Medium page, and use its date if provided. If you used the original blog version, cite that site instead. If dates differ, pick the date for the version you read. For container logic and choosing the version you consulted, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
