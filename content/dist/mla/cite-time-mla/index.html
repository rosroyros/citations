<h2>Overview, how to cite <em>Time</em> magazine in MLA 9</h2>
<p>In MLA 9th edition, citing a <em>Time</em> magazine article follows the same core pattern as most periodicals. You identify the article (the specific piece you read) and then the container (the magazine that published it). Your goal is to give readers enough information to find the exact article quickly, whether it was published in print or online.</p>
<p>A <em>Time</em> article citation usually appears in your <strong>Works Cited</strong> list and may also be referenced with an <strong>in-text citation</strong>. The Works Cited entry is the most detailed piece. It includes the author, the article title, the magazine title, publication date, and where the article can be found (page numbers for print, or a URL for online).</p>
<p>MLA 9 is designed to be consistent across formats. That consistency matters because <em>Time</em> articles can appear in print, on Time.com, in a database, or in an app. The citation should still clearly communicate who wrote it, what it is called, where it was published, and how to locate it.</p>
<h2>Core Works Cited format for a <em>Time</em> magazine article</h2>
<h3 id="print-version-typical-pattern">Print version (typical pattern)</h3>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Article." <em>Time</em>, Day Month Year, pp. page range.</strong></p>
<h3 id="online-version-on-timecom-typical-pattern">Online version on Time.com (typical pattern)</h3>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Article." <em>Time</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<h3 id="article-accessed-through-a-database-typical-pattern">Article accessed through a database (typical pattern)</h3>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Article." <em>Time</em>, Day Month Year, pp. page range. Database Name, URL or DOI.</strong></p>
<p>MLA calls <em>Time</em> the <strong>container</strong> because it contains the article. If you accessed the article through a database, that database becomes a second container.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-based-on-your-requirements">
<h2 >Author rules you must follow (based on your requirements)</h2>
<p>Your author rules affect the first element of the citation. They also affect alphabetizing in your Works Cited list.</p>
<h3 id="one-author">One author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the author’s <strong>full first name</strong>, not initials.</li>
<li>Invert the name for the first author: <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle.</strong></p>
<p>Why it matters: MLA Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element, usually the author’s last name. Inversion makes alphabetizing consistent and makes it easier for readers to scan.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted.</li>
<li>Second author is in normal order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</strong></p>
<p>Why it matters: This format keeps alphabetical order stable while still presenting both authors clearly.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>List only the first author (inverted, full first name).</li>
<li>Add <strong>et al.</strong> after the first author.</li>
<li>Do not list additional authors before et al.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<p>Why it matters: Long author lists can distract from the key information. MLA shortens them while still crediting the group.</p>
<h3 id="no-author">No author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <strong>title of the article</strong>.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</li>
<li>Alphabetize by the first important word in the title, ignoring A, An, The.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Readers can still locate the work by title, and your Works Cited remains consistent and searchable.</p>
<h2>Title rules for <em>Time</em> articles</h2>
<h3 id="article-title">Article title</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the article title in <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li>Use title case, meaning capitalize principal words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:<br />
- "How to Sleep Better During Stress"</p>
<h3 id="magazine-title">Magazine title</h3>
<ul>
<li>Italicize the magazine title: <em>Time</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: Quotation marks signal a shorter work inside a larger container, and italics signal the container itself.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="date-rules">
<h2 >Date rules</h2>
<p>MLA commonly uses:<br />
- <strong>Day Month Year</strong> (for specific dates), like 15 Oct. 2024<br />
- Or <strong>Month Year</strong> if no day is provided</p>
<p><em>Time</em> online articles usually show a full date. Use what is provided on the article page.</p>
<p>Why it matters: <em>Time</em> may publish multiple pieces with similar titles, and it may update articles. The date helps readers identify the correct version.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="page-numbers-vs-url-choosing-the-right-locator">
<h2 >Page numbers vs URL, choosing the right locator</h2>
<h3 id="print-article">Print article</h3>
<p>Include page numbers:<br />
- <strong>pp. 34-37.</strong></p>
<p>Why it matters: Page numbers tell the reader exactly where the article appears in the print issue.</p>
<h3 id="online-article">Online article</h3>
<p>Use a URL:<br />
- Include the direct URL to the article.<br />
- MLA does not require “https://” in every classroom, but it is often acceptable to include the full link. Your instructor may have a preference, so be consistent.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Online articles do not have stable page numbers, so the URL becomes the locator.</p>

<h2 >Examples (with explanations and correct formatting)</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-one-author-online-article-on-timecom">
<h2 >Example 1, one author, online article on Time.com</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Hsu, Hua. "Why Nostalgia Is So Powerful Right Now." <em>Time</em>, 12 May 2023, https://time.com/6270000/nostalgia-powerful-right-now/.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Author name</strong>: First author is inverted, and the first name is spelled out as Hua, not an initial.<br />
- <strong>Article title</strong>: In quotation marks.<br />
- <strong>Container</strong>: <em>Time</em> is italicized.<br />
- <strong>Date</strong>: Given in Day Month Year format.<br />
- <strong>Locator</strong>: URL is included because this is an online article.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation example</strong><br />
(Hsu)</p>
<p>Tip: If you mention the author in your sentence, you can omit the parenthetical author name.<br />
Example: Hsu argues that nostalgia can shape how people interpret uncertainty.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-print-magazine-article">
<h2 >Example 2, two authors, print magazine article</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Altman, Howard, and Leslie Dickstein. "Inside the Race to Reinvent Batteries." <em>Time</em>, 7 Aug. 2023, pp. 40-45.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Two authors</strong>: First author inverted, second author in normal order, joined by <strong>and</strong>.<br />
- <strong>Print locator</strong>: Page range uses <strong>pp.</strong> and a hyphen.<br />
- <strong>No URL</strong>: Because the example is a print article, page numbers are the best locator.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation example</strong><br />
(Altman and Dickstein 42)</p>
<p>Tip: In MLA, in-text citations for print sources often include a page number when available. Use the page where the quoted or referenced information appears.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-listed-online-article">
<h2 >Example 3, no author listed, online article</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
"How to Build Better Habits in 30 Days." <em>Time</em>, 3 Jan. 2024, https://time.com/0000000/build-better-habits-30-days/.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>No author</strong>: The citation starts with the title in quotation marks.<br />
- <strong>Alphabetizing</strong>: In your Works Cited list, alphabetize by “How,” not by “The,” since there is no initial article here. If the title began with “The,” you would ignore it for alphabetizing.<br />
- <strong>Container and date</strong>: <em>Time</em> italicized, date included.<br />
- <strong>Locator</strong>: URL included for an online piece.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation example</strong><br />
("How to Build Better Habits")</p>
<p>Tip: Keep the in-text title short if it is long. Use the first few words of the title exactly as they appear in the Works Cited entry.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter, beyond just formatting</h2>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-find-your-source-fast">They help readers find your source fast</h3>
<p>A good MLA citation is like a map. If the author, title, date, and locator are clear, your reader can locate the exact <em>Time</em> article without guessing.</p>
<h3 id="they-support-fairness-and-accuracy-in-credit">They support fairness and accuracy in credit</h3>
<p>Using full first names, as required here, reduces confusion between authors with similar last names. It also respects author identity by not reducing names to initials.</p>
<h3 id="they-keep-your-works-cited-organized">They keep your Works Cited organized</h3>
<p>Inverting the first author’s name is not just a style choice. It keeps your list alphabetized in a predictable way, which is one of the main purposes of Works Cited formatting.</p>
<h2>Practical tips for citing <em>Time</em> correctly</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copy details from the article page carefully</strong>: Author name spelling, date, and exact title matter.</li>
<li><strong>Use the article’s displayed author name</strong>: If <em>Time</em> lists a middle name, include it.</li>
<li><strong>Keep formatting consistent across your Works Cited</strong>: Date format, punctuation, and URL style should match from entry to entry.</li>
<li><strong>Prefer stable links when possible</strong>: Use the direct article URL, not a search results page.</li>
<li><strong>Check whether you used print or online</strong>: Do not include page numbers unless you actually used the print version or a PDF that shows stable page numbers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials instead of full first names</strong>: Your rule requires full first names, so do not write “Hsu, H.” Write “Hsu, Hua.”</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting to invert the first author</strong>: The first author must be “Last, First,” not “First Last.”</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author in a two-author citation</strong>: Only the first author is inverted. The second stays normal order.</li>
<li><strong>Listing all authors for three or more authors</strong>: Use the first author plus <strong>et al.</strong> only.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing up quotation marks and italics</strong>: Article title in quotes, <em>Time</em> in italics.</li>
<li><strong>Using “n.d.” when the date is missing</strong>: Do not use “n.d.” Instead, omit the date if truly unavailable, but check carefully because <em>Time</em> usually provides one.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Time Magazine citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<section class="content-section" id="special-cases">
<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
<h2>Special and edge cases when citing <em>Time</em> magazine in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing <em>Time</em> can be straightforward when an article has a clear author, a clear title, a date, and a stable URL. The tricky parts come from how <em>Time</em> publishes content across print issues, the website, newsletters, and syndicated or staff written pieces. The goal in MLA 9 is consistency and traceability, so a reader can find the exact version you used.</p>
<p>Your author rules matter here because <em>Time</em> often lists multiple contributors, uses group labels like “Time Staff,” or provides no author at all. Getting the author element right affects both your Works Cited entry and your in-text citations.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="1-print-issue-vs-website-version-and-what-to-do-when-they-differ">
<h2 >1) Print issue vs. website version, and what to do when they differ</h2>
<p>Sometimes a <em>Time</em> story appears in print and online with different details, for example a different headline, a different publication date, or added sections online. Treat the version you actually used as the source.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you read it in print</strong>, cite the print issue details (magazine title, date, page range).</li>
<li><strong>If you read it on the website</strong>, cite the web page details (site name, date, URL).</li>
<li><strong>Do not combine print page numbers with a web URL</strong> in the same entry. That mixes two versions and can make the source harder to locate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you accessed a PDF scan of the print issue through a database, it is usually best to cite it like print but include the database as the container if your instructor expects that. If you are unsure, ask whether your class treats databases as required containers.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="2-missing-author-and-how-to-start-with-the-title">
<h2 >2) Missing author, and how to start with the title</h2>
<p><em>Time</em> articles sometimes display no author, or the author line is not visible on certain pages. Under your rules, you do not invent an author and you do not use “Anonymous.” You start with the title.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <strong>article title in quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li>Alphabetize by the first significant word in the title, ignoring “A,” “An,” and “The.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using “Time” as the author when there is no author. In MLA, the publisher or site name does not replace the author unless it is truly a corporate author credited as such.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="3-corporate-or-staff-bylines-including-time-staff">
<h2 >3) Corporate or staff bylines, including “Time Staff”</h2>
<p>You may see bylines like “Time Staff,” “TIME Staff,” or “By Time Staff.” Treat that as the author exactly as credited, and apply your “full first name” rule only to personal names. A staff label is not a person, so it is not “inverted first name” style.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If the author is a group name</strong>, write it as shown, not inverted.</li>
<li>If the page lists both a named author and “Time Staff,” use the named author as the author, and ignore the staff label unless it is presented as the author.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If a page lists a named author and also says “Reporting by” or “With reporting by,” MLA usually treats the main byline as the author. Extra credits can be omitted unless your instructor wants them.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="4-two-authors-three-or-more-authors-and-contributor-lists">
<h2 >4) Two authors, three or more authors, and contributor lists</h2>
<p>Online magazine pieces sometimes list multiple writers, editors, photographers, and fact-checkers. MLA focuses on the author of the work you are citing.</p>
<p>Apply your rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> first author inverted, second author normal order, use “and.”</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors:</strong> first author inverted, then “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing all authors for a long contributor list. Under your rules, do not list more than the first author when there are three or more.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="5-dates-updates-and-last-modified-information">
<h2 >5) Dates, updates, and “last modified” information</h2>
<p><em>Time</em> pages may show:<br />
- a publication date,<br />
- an “Updated” date,<br />
- both.</p>
<p>In MLA 9, use the date that best matches the version you used. If the page clearly indicates an update that affects the content you read, you can use the updated date. If you only see a publication date, use that.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the page shows “Updated” but not what changed, it is still acceptable to cite the date displayed on the page. MLA does not require you to document every revision.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="6-urls-paywalls-and-unstable-links">
<h2 >6) URLs, paywalls, and unstable links</h2>
<p>Some <em>Time</em> links are stable, others include tracking parameters or redirect through short links.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>cleanest stable URL</strong> you can find.</li>
<li>Remove tracking parameters when possible (everything after a question mark is often removable).</li>
<li>MLA 9 does not require “https://” but it is acceptable to include it. Consistency matters more than the exact choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using a Google AMP link or a cached link. Prefer the canonical <em>time.com</em> URL.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="7-database-versions-gale-ebsco-proquest-and-reprints">
<h2 >7) Database versions (Gale, EBSCO, ProQuest) and reprints</h2>
<p>If you accessed a <em>Time</em> article through a library database, you are often viewing a licensed copy. In MLA 9, the database can function as a second container.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cite the article, then the magazine as the first container.</li>
<li>Add the database name as a second container, plus a stable link or accession number if provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the database provides a “Cite” tool, do not trust it blindly. It often uses initials, incorrect capitalization, or missing containers.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="8-in-text-citation-edge-cases">
<h2 >8) In-text citation edge cases</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author:</strong> use a shortened title in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate author:</strong> use the group name.</li>
<li><strong>Long titles:</strong> shorten to the first few words.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cite a web article with no page numbers, MLA does not require paragraph numbers. Use the author or title only.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-explanations-formatted-correctly">
<h2 >Examples with explanations (formatted correctly)</h2>
<h3>Example 1, Two authors on the <em>Time</em> website (apply full first names, inversion, and “and”)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Baker, Peter, and Susan Miller. “Inside the White House Negotiations.” <em>Time</em>, 14 Mar. 2024, https://time.com/inside-the-white-house-negotiations/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, <strong>Baker, Peter</strong>, using a full first name.<br />
- The second author is in normal order, <strong>Susan Miller</strong>, and joined with <strong>and</strong>.<br />
- The article title is in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>Time</em> is italicized as the magazine title.<br />
- The date is in MLA format (day month year).<br />
- The URL is included because it is a web source.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Writing “Baker, P.” or “Miller, S.”. Under your rules, do not use initials.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-no-author-listed-start-with-the-title-web-article">Example 2, No author listed, start with the title (web article)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“The Future of Remote Work Is Not What You Think.” <em>Time</em>, 2 Feb. 2023, https://time.com/future-of-remote-work/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- There is <strong>no author</strong>, so the entry begins with the title.<br />
- The title is in quotation marks because it is an article, not a whole magazine issue.<br />
- <em>Time</em> is the container (italicized).<br />
- The date and URL help readers locate the exact article.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation example:</strong><br />
- (“Future of Remote Work”)</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Starting with <em>Time</em> as if it were the author. If no author is credited, the title is the first element.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">Example 3, Three or more authors, use “et al.” after the first author only</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Hernandez, Maria, et al. “How Heat Waves Are Reshaping Summer Travel.” <em>Time</em>, 20 July 2022, https://time.com/how-heat-waves-are-reshaping-summer-travel/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted and uses a full first name, <strong>Hernandez, Maria</strong>.<br />
- Because there are three or more authors, you list only the first author, then <strong>et al.</strong><br />
- You do not list additional authors before “et al.” under your rules.<br />
- The rest follows standard MLA web article formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Listing all authors, or writing “Hernandez, M., et al.”. Use full first names.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>These special cases matter because <em>Time</em> content can be republished, updated, or presented in multiple formats. MLA is designed to help a reader locate your exact source quickly. Clear author handling prevents confusion in in-text citations, especially when you cite multiple <em>Time</em> articles. Consistent formatting also improves credibility, since messy citations often signal rushed research even when the research is strong.</p>
<h2>Quick practical checklist for <em>Time</em> citations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confirm whether you used <strong>print</strong>, <strong>web</strong>, or a <strong>database</strong> version.</li>
<li>Use <strong>full first names</strong> for people.</li>
<li>Invert the <strong>first author only</strong>.</li>
<li>Two authors: use <strong>and</strong>, second author not inverted.</li>
<li>Three or more: first author plus <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>No author: start with the <strong>title</strong>.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>date shown on the page</strong>, and prefer a clean, stable <strong>URL</strong>.</li>
<li>Do not mix print page numbers with web URLs in one entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you share a specific <em>Time</em> link or a screenshot of the article header, I can format the exact Works Cited entry and the matching in-text citation using your rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-time-magazine-article-in-mla-9-if-i-read-it-online">How do I cite a Time magazine article in MLA 9 if I read it online?</h3>
<p>For a Time article you read on Time.com, use the MLA 9 format for a web article. Start with the author’s name, then put the article title in quotation marks. Next, italicize the website name, usually Time. Include the publisher only if it differs from the site name, it often does not need to be repeated. Add the publication date, then the URL. Include an access date only if your instructor asks for it or if the page is likely to change. Practical example, if you used a Time.com feature in a research paper about climate policy, cite the specific page you read, not the magazine brand in general. If there is no author listed, begin with the title. For guidance, see the MLA web page format: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and the MLA page on URLs and DOIs: https://style.mla.org/do-i-need-to-include-urls-in-works-cited/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-print-time-magazine-article-in-mla-9-including-the-date-and-page-numbers">How do I cite a print Time magazine article in MLA 9, including the date and page numbers?</h3>
<p>For a print issue of Time, cite it like a magazine article. List the author, then the article title in quotation marks. Italicize the magazine title, Time. Add the publication date of the issue, then the page range, for example, pp. 34-37. You usually do not include a URL for print, and you do not need the city of publication in MLA 9. Practical scenario, if you found an older Time issue in your library stacks and used a profile piece for a biography assignment, the page numbers matter because they help readers locate the article in the physical issue. If the article continues on nonconsecutive pages, list the first page plus a plus sign, for example, p. 34+. For general MLA citations and containers, consult: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-time-article-has-no-author-listed-how-do-i-cite-it-in-mla-9">What if the Time article has no author listed, how do I cite it in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>If a Time article does not name an author, start the Works Cited entry with the article title in quotation marks. Then list the container, italicized Time for print or Time for the website, followed by the publication date and the location information, either page numbers for print or a URL for online. Do not invent an author, and do not automatically use Time as the author unless the page clearly credits the organization as the author. Practical scenario, many short news updates or staff briefs may omit a byline. In your in-text citation, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, plus the page number for print if available. If you need help deciding when an organization counts as an author, see MLA guidance on corporate authorship: https://style.mla.org/corporate-authors/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-time-article-i-found-in-a-library-database-like-ebsco-or-proquest-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Time article I found in a library database like EBSCO or ProQuest in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>When you access a Time article through a database, you usually cite the article as it appears, then add the database as a second container. Start with author and article title. Then italicize Time, add the issue date, and include page numbers if the database provides them. After that, list the database name in italics, for example, ProQuest or EBSCOhost, followed by a DOI or a stable URL or permalink. Practical scenario, if your instructor requires you to use peer reviewed sources plus reputable journalism, you might pull a Time article from a database for convenience. The database link is important because it is the version you actually used. For container and database formatting, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and MLA advice on permalinks and URLs: https://style.mla.org/do-i-need-to-include-urls-in-works-cited/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-time-magazine-cover-or-an-image-from-time-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Time magazine cover or an image from Time in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite a Time cover or image, treat it as an image or a work within a container. If you are citing a print cover, start with the creator if known, such as the photographer or illustrator. Then give the title of the image if it has one, or provide a clear description like “Time cover featuring [subject].” Italicize Time, add the issue date, and include page information if relevant, for a cover you can use “cover.” For an online image, include the URL and the publication date if shown. Practical scenario, if you analyze cover design for a media studies project, cite the specific cover you discuss and include enough details for readers to find it. For MLA image citation basics, see: https://style.mla.org/citing-images/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-time-articles-in-mla-9-especially-when-there-is-no-page-number">How do I do in-text citations for Time articles in MLA 9, especially when there is no page number?</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations usually include the author’s last name and a page number, for example, (Smith 42). For a Time article you read online, there is often no stable page number. In that case, use just the author’s last name in parentheses, for example, (Smith). If there is no author, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, for example, (“Election Updates”). Do not use paragraph numbers unless your instructor requests them and the text clearly displays them. Practical scenario, if you quote a sentence from a Time.com interview in a digital essay, the parenthetical citation can be just the author name, and your Works Cited entry does the heavy lifting. For MLA in-text citation rules, see: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations-mla/.</p>
