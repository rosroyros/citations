<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-youtube-video-citation-format-works-cited">
<h2 >MLA 9 YouTube Video Citation Format (Works Cited)</h2>
<p>In MLA 9th edition, a YouTube video is usually treated as a work found in a container. The “work” is the video itself, and the “container” is the website YouTube. Your goal is to give readers enough information to find the exact video quickly and to credit the correct creator.</p>
<p>A standard MLA Works Cited entry for a YouTube video often looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Author or creator. “Title of Video.” <em>YouTube</em>, uploaded by Channel Name (if different from author), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year (optional).</strong></p>
<p>Not every video has every element, so MLA lets you include what is available and skip what is not. The most important pieces are the creator, the video title, the website, the date, and the URL.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-parts-of-the-citation-in-order">
<h2 >Core Parts of the Citation, In Order</h2>
<h3 id="1-author-the-creator-of-the-video">1) Author (the creator of the video)</h3>
<p>This is the person or group responsible for the content. In MLA, the author goes first because Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element.</p>
<p>Follow your rules for names:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use full first names, not initials.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invert the first author’s name</strong>: Last, First Middle.</li>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: first author inverted, second author normal order, joined with <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: first author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: start with the title.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the creator is an organization or a group, use the organization name as the author.</p>
<h3 id="2-title-of-the-video-in-quotation-marks">2) Title of the video (in quotation marks)</h3>
<p>Put the video title in quotation marks because it is a short work inside a larger container.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- “How to Solve Quadratic Equations”</p>
<p>Capitalize the title using MLA title case, which means capitalize major words.</p>
<h3 id="3-container-youtube-in-italics">3) Container: YouTube (in italics)</h3>
<p>The container is the platform hosting the video.</p>
<p>Write:<br />
- <em>YouTube</em>,</p>
<h3 id="4-uploaded-by-only-if-needed">4) “Uploaded by” (only if needed)</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Uploaded by Channel Name</strong> when the channel is different from the author you listed at the start. If the author and the channel are the same, you can usually skip “uploaded by” because it would repeat information.</p>
<p>Write:<br />
- uploaded by CrashCourse,</p>
<h3 id="5-publication-date">5) Publication date</h3>
<p>Use the date the video was uploaded. MLA format is:<br />
- Day Month Year (example: 12 Mar. 2023)</p>
<p>If you cannot find a day, use what you have (Month Year, or Year). Do not invent a date.</p>
<h3 id="6-url">6) URL</h3>
<p>Use the direct URL to the video. MLA 9 allows you to use a shortened URL, but a full URL is also fine. Do not put the URL in angle brackets.</p>
<h3 id="7-access-date-optional-but-sometimes-helpful">7) Access date (optional, but sometimes helpful)</h3>
<p>MLA says access dates are optional, but they are useful when a source can change, be removed, or be updated. YouTube videos sometimes disappear or get edited, so an access date can be a smart choice.</p>
<p>Write:<br />

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why These Rules Matter</h2>
<h3 id="alphabetizing-and-easy-scanning">Alphabetizing and easy scanning</h3>
<p>Inverting the first author’s name, for example <strong>Nguyen, Alana Marie</strong>, helps your Works Cited list stay consistent and easy to alphabetize. Readers can scan quickly for last names, which is the main reason MLA uses inversion.</p>
<h3 id="clear-credit-and-ethical-use">Clear credit and ethical use</h3>
<p>Using full first names instead of initials helps identify the creator accurately, especially when multiple creators share a last name. It also shows respect for the creator’s identity.</p>
<h3 id="reliable-retrieval">Reliable retrieval</h3>
<p>YouTube has many similar titles and many reuploads. The combination of title, date, and URL helps readers locate the exact video you used. The access date can help explain what version you saw if the video changes later.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-explanations">
<h2 >Examples (With Explanations)</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-individual-creator-channel-and-author-are-the-same">Example 1: Individual creator, channel and author are the same</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Nguyen, Alana Marie. “How to Write a Strong Thesis Statement.” <em>YouTube</em>, 12 Mar. 2023, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef12345.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Author first, inverted</strong>: Nguyen, Alana Marie.<br />
- <strong>Video title in quotes</strong>: “How to Write a Strong Thesis Statement.”<br />
- <strong>Container in italics</strong>: <em>YouTube</em>.<br />
- <strong>No “uploaded by” line</strong> because the author is the uploader, so adding it would repeat the same name.<br />
- <strong>Date included</strong> in Day Month Year format.<br />
- <strong>URL included</strong> so the reader can find the exact video.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall this avoids</strong><br />
Some students list the channel name as the author even when a real person is clearly credited. If the video clearly identifies the creator, use that creator as the author.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-follow-your-two-author-rule">Example 2: Two authors (follow your two author rule)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Patel, Rina Saanvi, and Jordan Michael Lee. “Beginner Yoga for Lower Back Pain.” <em>YouTube</em>, 8 Jan. 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghijk67890.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>First author inverted</strong>: Patel, Rina Saanvi<br />
- <strong>Second author not inverted</strong>: Jordan Michael Lee<br />
- Uses <strong>and</strong> between names, as MLA prefers.<br />
- Title in quotes, then <em>YouTube</em>, then date, then URL.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall this avoids</strong><br />
Do not invert the second author. A frequent error is writing: “Patel, Rina Saanvi, and Lee, Jordan Michael.” That is not the MLA format for two authors.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-listed-start-with-the-title">Example 3: No author listed (start with the title)</h3>
<p>Sometimes a video does not clearly identify an author, or the uploader is unclear, or you cannot confidently determine a creator name. In that case, MLA allows you to start with the title.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“How to Replace a Kitchen Faucet, Step by Step.” <em>YouTube</em>, 4 May 2021, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmnop24680. Accessed 18 Sept. 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>No author</strong>, so the citation begins with the <strong>title</strong>.<br />
- The title is in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>YouTube</em> is the container.<br />
- The date and URL help readers locate the video.<br />
- An <strong>access date</strong> is included, which is useful because instructional videos are sometimes removed, reuploaded, or updated.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall this avoids</strong><br />
Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” MLA does not require those placeholders for YouTube videos. If there is no author, start with the title.</p>

<h2 >Practical Tips for Getting the Details Right</h2>
<h3 id="use-the-share-link-but-check-it">Use the “Share” link, but check it</h3>
<p>YouTube’s Share button gives a clean URL. Make sure it leads to the exact video you used.</p>
<h3 id="decide-who-the-author-really-is">Decide who the “author” really is</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a real person is credited and clearly responsible for the content, use that person as author.</li>
<li>If the content is produced by a brand or organization, use the organization name.</li>
<li>If you cannot confidently identify an author, start with the title.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-uploaded-by-only-when-it-adds-information">Use “uploaded by” only when it adds information</h3>
<p>If the channel name is different from the author, “uploaded by” helps readers find the video.</p>
<p>Example pattern:</p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Last, First Middle. “Title.” <em>YouTube</em>, uploaded by Channel Name, Day Month Year, URL.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keep-punctuation-and-italics-consistent">Keep punctuation and italics consistent</h3>
<p>MLA punctuation is part of the format. Periods and commas signal where each element ends. Also remember:<br />
- Video title: quotation marks<br />
- YouTube: italics</p>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Youtube Video Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-youtube-format-quick-baseline">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 YouTube format (quick baseline)</h2>
<p>Before the edge cases, it helps to anchor the “normal” MLA 9 Works Cited entry for a YouTube video:</p>
<p><strong>Creator (or uploader). “Title of Video.” <em>YouTube</em>, uploaded by Channel Name (if different), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year (optional).</strong></p>
<p>In practice, YouTube citations often vary because “creator,” “uploader,” and “publisher” can be different, and because YouTube pages change over time. The special cases below explain how to adapt while keeping MLA’s goal, which is helping readers find the exact source you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-individual-person-vs-channel-name-who-counts-as-the-author">
<h2 >Special case 1: Individual person vs. channel name (who counts as the author)</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>Use the name of the person or group that is most responsible for the content as the author. On YouTube, that is often the channel name. Sometimes the channel clearly represents a real person. Sometimes it is a brand, organization, or show title.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>MLA’s first element is the author because it helps readers quickly see who is speaking and it determines alphabetization in your Works Cited list. Choosing the most responsible creator also improves credibility, because it separates the speaker from the platform.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the channel is a person and the full name is available, use the full name. Avoid initials.</li>
<li>If the channel is a brand or organization, use the full name of the organization as it appears.</li>
<li>If you cannot confidently identify a person behind a channel, treat the channel name as the author.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not treat “YouTube” as the author. YouTube is the container, not the creator.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-uploaded-by-is-different-from-the-creator">
<h2 >Special case 2: “Uploaded by” is different from the creator</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>If the author and uploader are different, MLA lets you include <strong>Uploaded by</strong> after the container (<em>YouTube</em>). Use this when it genuinely helps identify responsibility. For example, a lecture by a professor might be uploaded by a university department channel. Or a film clip might be uploaded by a distributor’s channel.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>This clarifies who made the content versus who posted it. That distinction can matter for trust and for locating the video later.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the author and the channel name are identical, you usually do not need “uploaded by.”</li>
<li>If the uploader is the only identity available, treat the uploader as the author and skip “uploaded by.”</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-no-author-listed-or-author-unclear">
<h2 >Special case 3: No author listed (or author unclear)</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>If there is no clear author or uploader identity you can reasonably use, start with the <strong>title</strong> of the video in quotation marks. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>MLA prefers accurate information over placeholders. Starting with the title still allows readers to locate the video and keeps your citation honest.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the video title exactly as shown, including capitalization and punctuation.</li>
<li>For alphabetization, ignore A, An, and The.</li>

<h2 >Special case 4: Two authors or three or more authors (your name rules)</h2>
<p>YouTube videos sometimes credit multiple hosts, interviewers, or creators.</p>

<p><strong>Last, First Middle and First Last. “Title.” <em>YouTube</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>

<h2 >Special case 6: Missing or unclear date</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>YouTube usually provides a date, but sometimes reuploads, shorts, or embedded pages make it hard to confirm. If you truly cannot find a date, MLA allows you to omit it. Then consider adding an <strong>Accessed</strong> date because the page may change.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Dates help readers understand context and version. When dates are missing, an access date helps document when you saw the content.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not insert “n.d.” MLA does not require that placeholder.</p>

<h2 >Special case 7: Live streams, premieres, and recordings</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>Cite the video as you viewed it on YouTube. Use the date shown on the video page. If it is a live stream recording, the date usually reflects when it was streamed or published.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Live content can be edited, trimmed, or reuploaded. Using the page’s date and URL is the most reliable path for a reader to find the same version.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the title includes “Live,” keep it as part of the title. Do not add extra labels unless they appear on the page.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="special-case-8-youtube-shorts">
<h2 >Special case 8: YouTube Shorts</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>Cite Shorts like other YouTube videos. The main difference is that Shorts sometimes have minimal metadata. Use what you can verify, and add an access date if details are sparse.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Shorts are easy to repost and harder to track. Strong identifying details reduce confusion.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="special-case-9-time-stamps-for-quoting-a-specific-moment">
<h2 >Special case 9: Time stamps for quoting a specific moment</h2>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<p>MLA typically handles time stamps in the <strong>in-text citation</strong>, not the Works Cited entry. In your in-text citation, you can add a time range after the author or title.</p>
<p>Example in text: (Channel Name 2:10 to 2:45)</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Videos are long, and readers need a path to the exact moment you are analyzing.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Use consistent formatting for time, such as 2:10 or 01:02:15 if the video is long.</p>

<h2 >Example 1: Channel is a person, standard case</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Smith, John Michael. “How to Read Poetry for Meaning.” <em>YouTube</em>, 14 Mar. 2023, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcdef12345.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author is a person, so the name is inverted as <strong>Smith, John Michael</strong>.<br />
- The video title is in quotation marks because it is a short work within a larger container.<br />
- <em>YouTube</em> is italicized as the container.<br />
- The date is in MLA day month year format, with the month abbreviated.<br />
- The URL is included without extra tracking details.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Do not write “J. M. Smith.” Your rule requires full first names, and it also improves clarity.</p>

Garcia, Maria Elena and David Chen. “Explaining Inflation in Five Minutes.” <em>YouTube</em>, 2 Feb. 2024, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghijk67890.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- Two authors are listed because both are credited as creators.<br />
- Only the first author is inverted. The second stays in normal order.<br />
- “and” is used between authors, as MLA prefers.<br />
- The rest follows standard YouTube format.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Do not invert the second name, and do not use an ampersand.</p>

National Gallery of Art. “Conservation of Oil Paintings: Varnish Removal.” <em>YouTube</em>, uploaded by NGA Conservation Department, 9 Sept. 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmnop24680.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The organization is responsible for the content, so it is the author.<br />
- “uploaded by” is useful here because the uploader name gives a more specific department identity, which can help readers locate the exact channel if the institution has multiple channels.<br />
- The format still keeps <em>YouTube</em> as the container, not the author.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Do not start with “YouTube.” That would misidentify the source’s creator.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-youtube-video-in-mla-9-for-my-works-cited-page">How do I cite a YouTube video in MLA 9 for my Works Cited page?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, a YouTube video entry usually includes the creator, the video title in quotation marks, the site name YouTube in italics, the uploader (if different from the creator), the upload date, and the URL. Use this common template: Creator or channel name. "Video Title." YouTube, uploaded by Uploader (if different), Day Month Year, URL. If the creator is an individual, use Last name, First name. If it is a channel, use the channel name as it appears. Example: Kurzgesagt. "The Immune System Explained." YouTube, 12 Mar. 2020, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXX. If you are missing an element, omit it rather than guessing. For official guidance and examples, see Purdue OWL: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_electronic_sources.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-use-the-channel-name-or-the-persons-real-name-when-citing-a-youtube-video-in-mla">Do I use the channel name or the person’s real name when citing a YouTube video in MLA?</h3>
<p>Use the name that best identifies the creator for your reader. If the video clearly credits an individual as the creator or speaker and you can verify the real name from a reliable source, you may list the person’s name. If the channel name is the primary identifier, and the real name is not clearly stated or is hard to confirm, use the channel name. This is common for organizations and branded channels. Practical scenario: you cite a TED-Ed video, the channel is TED-Ed, and the speaker is a narrator not prominently credited. In that case, list TED-Ed as the author. If a professor posts a lecture on a personal channel and is clearly identified, list their name. MLA guidance on authors and containers can help you decide: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-specific-timestamp-or-quote-from-a-youtube-video-in-mla-in-text-citations">How do I cite a specific timestamp or quote from a YouTube video in MLA in-text citations?</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations for videos typically use the author or channel name in parentheses. If you are quoting or referring to a specific moment, include a timestamp in the in-text citation so readers can find it quickly. Example: (Kurzgesagt 2:15 to 2:40). If you mention the author in your sentence, you can shorten the parenthetical: (2:15 to 2:40). Practical scenario: you quote a statement at 10 minutes, 5 seconds into a documentary clip. Your in-text citation can be (Channel Name 10:05). Your Works Cited entry still includes the full video details and URL. MLA does not require timestamps, but they are strongly helpful for audiovisual sources. For more on MLA in-text citations, see: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-youtube-video-has-no-date-no-author-or-i-cannot-find-the-uploader-how-do-i-cite-it-in-mla">What if the YouTube video has no date, no author, or I cannot find the uploader, how do I cite it in MLA?</h3>
<p>If a YouTube video is missing information, MLA recommends citing what you can and omitting what you cannot verify. If there is no clear author or channel attribution, start with the title in quotation marks. If there is no upload date, omit the date rather than using “n.d.” unless your instructor asks for it. If the uploader is present but the creator is unclear, use the uploader as the author and include “uploaded by” only when it adds clarity, such as when the author and uploader differ. Practical scenario: a reuploaded clip from a TV show has an unclear creator and no reliable credits. Start with the video title, then YouTube, then the channel name if available, then the URL, and add an access date only if required by your instructor. MLA’s core elements overview is useful here: https://style.mla.org/mla-core-elements/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-youtube-video-i-watched-in-a-playlist-embedded-on-a-website-or-through-a-learning-platform">How do I cite a YouTube video I watched in a playlist, embedded on a website, or through a learning platform?</h3>
<p>Cite the version you actually used, and make it easy for your reader to locate it. If you watched the video on YouTube, cite YouTube and include the direct YouTube URL. If you watched an embedded YouTube video on another site and you are discussing the context of that site, you can cite the website as the container and include the page URL, but it is often still helpful to include the YouTube link if available. Practical scenario: your course LMS embeds a YouTube lecture. If the LMS restricts access, cite the YouTube URL if you can access it, or cite the LMS page as a separate source if the YouTube link is not accessible. When in doubt, follow MLA container rules and prioritize retrievability. See MLA’s container explanation: https://style.mla.org/containers/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-youtube-short-live-stream-or-reuploaded-clip-in-mla-9">How do I cite a YouTube Short, live stream, or reuploaded clip in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>For YouTube Shorts, live streams, and reuploads, the structure is similar, but you should label the format when it helps clarify what you used. You can add a description like “YouTube video,” “Short,” or “Livestream” after the title if your instructor expects it, or if the title is ambiguous. Include the upload date shown on YouTube, and use the stable URL. Practical scenario: you cite a live stream that later becomes an archived video. Use the date displayed for the archived upload, and cite the archived URL. For a reuploaded clip, cite the uploader as the author if they are responsible for the posted version, but be cautious about attributing original authorship. If you need to credit the original creator, discuss that in your text and cite the most authoritative source you can find. For examples of citing online videos, see: https://style.mla.org/citing-online-videos/</p>
