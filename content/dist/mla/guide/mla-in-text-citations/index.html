<h2 >Introduction</h2>
<p>If you have ever stared at a sentence and wondered, “Do I put the author in the text or in parentheses,” you are not alone. MLA in-text citations look simple until you are trying to make them fit smoothly into your writing, especially when you are balancing clarity, flow, and the rules. This guide is here to help you feel confident using MLA parenthetical citations without interrupting your voice, and to help you understand what your reader needs in order to find your source quickly in your Works Cited list.</p>
<p>You will see two main options throughout this guide, parenthetical vs narrative citations. Sometimes you want the author’s name to be part of your sentence because it strengthens your claim and makes the writing feel more natural. Other times you want the citation to stay in the background so your point stays front and center. You will learn how to choose between these approaches, and how to format each one correctly, including where punctuation goes and how to avoid common mistakes that instructors notice immediately.</p>
<p>This introduction also recognizes the messy situations that cause the most stress. What happens with multiple authors, especially when you have three or more names? What if your source has no page numbers, like many websites, videos, and online articles? How do you handle MLA quoting when you are working with short quotations, longer block quotations, or quotes that need changes like brackets and ellipses? You will also get clear guidance on indirect sources, when you found a quotation inside another source and you need to cite it ethically and transparently.</p>
<p>Along the way, you will see practical examples you can copy and adapt. You will also learn how MLA page numbers work in citations, and what to do when page numbers are missing or inconsistent. The goal is not just correctness, it is helping you build citations that feel effortless, protect you from accidental plagiarism, and make your writing easier to follow.</p>

<h2 >Understanding MLA 9th Edition</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-philosophy-of-mla-in-text-citations">
<h2 >Core philosophy of MLA in-text citations</h2>
<p>MLA in-text citations are built around one main goal, helping your reader find the exact source of your information quickly and confidently. MLA does this by linking two parts of your paper.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The in-text citation</strong> points to the source in a brief way inside your paragraph.</li>
<li><strong>The Works Cited entry</strong> gives the full publication details.</li>
</ol>
<p>In MLA 9, the guiding idea is simple. Give only what your reader needs to locate the source in your Works Cited list, and to find the specific passage you used. Most of the time, that means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author last name</strong> (or a shortened title if there is no author)</li>
<li><strong>Page number</strong> (or another location marker when pages do not exist)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why MLA in-text citations are short. They are not meant to repeat everything about the source. They are meant to act like a clear signpost.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-philosophy-matters">Why this philosophy matters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>It supports credibility.</strong> Readers can verify your claims.</li>
<li><strong>It avoids clutter.</strong> Your writing stays readable because citations stay brief.</li>
<li><strong>It prevents accidental plagiarism.</strong> You show exactly which ideas and words are not yours.</li>
<li><strong>It creates consistency.</strong> Every source is traceable using the same basic logic.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-container-system-in-mla-9-and-how-it-connects-to-in-text-citations">
<h2 >The “container” system in MLA 9 and how it connects to in-text citations</h2>
<p>MLA 9 uses a “container” approach in the Works Cited list. A container is the larger whole that holds the item you used. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A journal article is contained in a journal.</li>
<li>A short story is contained in an anthology.</li>
<li>A video clip is contained on a website.</li>
<li>A song is contained in an album.</li>
</ul>
<p>The container system mostly shapes your <strong>Works Cited entries</strong>, but it also affects in-text citations in an important way. Your in-text citation must match the first element of your Works Cited entry.</p>
<p>That first element is usually the <strong>author</strong>. If there is no author, the first element is usually the <strong>title</strong>. This is where the container idea matters, because many sources have multiple titles. You need to choose the correct title to lead with, so that your in-text citation points to the right Works Cited entry.</p>
<h3 id="item-title-vs-container-title-the-key-distinction">Item title vs. container title, the key distinction</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Item</strong>: the specific work you used, such as an article, chapter, episode, or web page.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: the larger source that holds the item, such as a journal, edited book, TV series, or website.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Works Cited, item titles are often in quotation marks, and container titles are often italicized. In in-text citations, you usually use the author’s name, so you do not have to decide between item and container titles. However, when there is no author, you use a shortened version of the title, and you must shorten the correct one, usually the item title.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-in-text-citation-pattern">
<h2 >The basic MLA in-text citation pattern</h2>
<h3 id="parenthetical-citation">Parenthetical citation</h3>
<p>Most MLA in-text citations follow this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(AuthorLastName PageNumber)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Example format:<br />
- (Morrison 42)</p>
<p>If you name the author in your sentence, put only the page number in parentheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morrison argues that memory shapes identity (42).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-there-is-no-page-number">What if there is no page number</h3>
<p>MLA prefers page numbers when available. If a source has no stable page numbers, you may cite another locator if it is helpful, such as a chapter, section, or time stamp. If there is no useful locator, you can cite only the author or title.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-that-affect-in-text-citations-and-works-cited-alignment">
<h2 >Author rules that affect in-text citations and Works Cited alignment</h2>
<p>Even though the rules you provided focus on Works Cited author formatting, they still matter for in-text citations because consistency prevents confusion.</p>
<h3 id="full-names-and-inversion-why-it-still-matters">Full names and inversion, why it still matters</h3>
<p>In MLA 9 Works Cited entries, author names use <strong>full first names</strong>, not initials, and the first author is <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct Works Cited author format: <strong>Morrison, Toni</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Morrison, T.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your in-text citation still uses the <strong>last name only</strong>, but the Works Cited entry must be accurate and consistent so the reader can find it. If you use initials in Works Cited, you can create ambiguity, especially when multiple authors share a last name.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-authors-the-reader-needs-a-predictable-pattern">Multiple authors, the reader needs a predictable pattern</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: list both last names in the in-text citation.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: use the first author’s last name plus <strong>et al.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In Works Cited, MLA 9 also uses “and” for two authors, and “et al.” after the first author for three or more. This parallel structure makes it easier for readers to match in-text citations to Works Cited entries.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-title-becomes-the-key">No author, title becomes the key</h3>
<p>When there is no author, MLA 9 says to start the Works Cited entry with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”. The in-text citation then uses a shortened version of that title.</p>

<h2 >Examples with detailed explanations</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-one-author-print-book-with-page-numbers">
<h2 >Example 1, one author, print book with page numbers</h2>
<p><strong>In your sentence (quotation):</strong><br />
Morrison describes the character’s recollection as “a kind of living archive” (42).</p>
<p><strong>What this tells the reader:</strong><br />
- The source is listed in Works Cited under <strong>Morrison</strong>.<br />
- The quoted words are on <strong>page 42</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why the rule matters:</strong><br />
If your Works Cited entry begins with <strong>Morrison, Toni</strong>, the reader can find it instantly. If you had used initials in Works Cited, such as “Morrison, T.,” it could be unclear which Morrison you mean, especially in a research paper with many sources.</p>
<p><strong>Correct Works Cited author formatting reminder:</strong><br />
- Morrison, Toni, not Morrison, T.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-matching-in-text-citation-to-works-cited">
<h2 >Example 2, two authors, matching in-text citation to Works Cited</h2>
<p><strong>In-text citation (paraphrase):</strong><br />
Recent studies connect sleep quality to long-term attention and memory (Garcia and Patel 118).</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way:</strong><br />
- Two authors means you include both last names in the in-text citation.<br />
- You use “and,” not an ampersand.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited alignment:</strong><br />
Your Works Cited entry would begin with the first author inverted, and the second author in normal order, using full first names.</p>
<ul>
<li>Garcia, Maria, and Sanjay Patel. …</li>
</ul>
<p>This matters because the in-text citation begins with “Garcia,” and the Works Cited entry also begins with “Garcia,” so the reader can match them immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong><br />
- Incorrect in-text style: (Garcia &amp; Patel 118)<br />
MLA uses “and,” not “&amp;.”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-web-page-contained-in-a-website">
<h2 >Example 3, no author, web page contained in a website</h2>
<p>Imagine you used a web page titled “Climate Change Effects,” and there is no listed author.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation:</strong><br />
The report predicts increased coastal flooding within decades (“Climate Change Effects”).</p>
<p><strong>Why the container system matters here:</strong><br />
The item you used is the web page, so the title you cite should be the item title, not the website name. In Works Cited, the entry would start with the item title, then list the website as the container.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited alignment (illustrative structure):</strong><br />
“Climate Change Effects.” <em>Nature Today</em>, …  </p>
<p>Because the Works Cited entry starts with the title, your in-text citation must also point to that title. MLA also advises you not to use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” as placeholders, since they do not help the reader locate the entry.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong><br />
Citing the container title instead of the item title. If you wrote (“Nature Today”), your reader might not find the correct entry quickly, especially if you used multiple pages from that same website.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-smooth-integration">Tips for smooth integration</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name the author in your sentence when possible.</strong> It reduces parentheses and improves flow.</li>
<li><strong>Cite the specific location.</strong> Use page numbers when available, and use time stamps for audiovisual sources when helpful.</li>
<li><strong>Make your in-text citation match the Works Cited first element.</strong> This is the most important “link” in MLA.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">Common pitfalls to avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials in Works Cited author names.</strong> MLA 9 emphasizes full first names, which improves clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author’s name in Works Cited.</strong> Only the first author is inverted in a two-author entry.</li>
<li><strong>Listing multiple authors in Works Cited before “et al.”</strong> For three or more authors, MLA 9 uses the first author plus “et al.”</li>
<li><strong>Using “Anonymous” or “n.d.” for missing authors.</strong> MLA 9 says to begin with the title instead.</li>
<li><strong>Citing the wrong title when there is no author.</strong> Use the item title that begins the Works Cited entry, not the container title.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-overall">
<h2 >Why these rules matter overall</h2>
<p>MLA’s in-text citation system works because it is predictable. The reader sees a brief cue in your paragraph, then finds the full source easily in Works Cited. The container system supports this by organizing complex sources, especially digital and multi-part works, in a consistent structure. When you follow MLA 9 author and title rules carefully, your citations become a reliable map. That reliability strengthens your argument and makes your research easier to trust.</p>

<h2 >Author Formatting Rules</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-name-formatting-in-mla-9-works-cited">
<h2 >Author Name Formatting in MLA 9 (Works Cited)</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, the author name is usually the first piece of information in a Works Cited entry. Getting the author format right matters because it helps readers quickly identify who created the source, it supports accurate alphabetical ordering in your Works Cited list, and it makes your citations consistent and easy to scan. MLA 9 also encourages clarity in naming, which is why it emphasizes using full first names instead of initials whenever possible.</p>
<p>Below are the core rules for full names, name inversion, two authors using “and,” and using “et al.” for three or more authors. These rules apply across source types, including books, articles, websites, reports, and videos.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="use-full-first-names-not-initials">
<h2 >Use full first names, not initials</h2>
<p>MLA 9 format calls for the author’s full first name rather than an initial. This makes citations clearer and helps avoid confusion when multiple authors share the same last name or first initial. It also reflects the MLA goal of identifying authors precisely and respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="correct">Correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>Morrison, Toni  </li>
<li>Garcia, Maria Elena  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incorrect">Incorrect</h3>
<ul>
<li>Morrison, T.  </li>
<li>Morrison, T. E.  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Use the name as it appears in the source, but if the source provides the full first name, do not reduce it to an initial. If you only have an initial and cannot find the full name, you may have to use what is available, but MLA 9’s preferred practice is full first names whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not “upgrade” a name by guessing what an initial stands for. Only use a full name if you can confirm it from a reliable place, such as the source itself, the publisher page, or the author’s professional profile.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="invert-the-first-authors-name-last-first-middle">
<h2 >Invert the first author’s name (Last, First Middle)</h2>
<p>In MLA 9 Works Cited entries, the first author’s name is inverted. That means you put the last name first, then a comma, then the first name, and then the middle name if it is included.</p>
<p>This inversion is important because Works Cited lists are alphabetized by the first element in each entry. Putting the last name first makes it easy to sort and locate sources.</p>
<h3 id="correct-format">Correct format</h3>
<p>Last name, First name Middle name (if given)</p>
<h3 id="correct">Correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smith, John David  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incorrect">Incorrect</h3>
<ul>
<li>John David Smith  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you are using citation tools, double-check that they invert only the first author in multi-author works. Some tools incorrectly invert every author, which creates MLA errors.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="two-authors-use-and-do-not-invert-the-second-author">
<h2 >Two authors: use “and,” do not invert the second author</h2>
<p>When a source has two authors, MLA 9 uses a specific pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>List the first author inverted, Last, First.</li>
<li>Add a comma after the first author’s name.</li>
<li>Add the word “and.”</li>
<li>List the second author in normal order, First Last.</li>
</ol>
<p>This rule matters because MLA balances two goals, alphabetical ordering and readability. The first author determines where the entry appears alphabetically, and the second author remains easy to read in natural name order.</p>
<h3 id="correct">Correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>Garcia, Maria, and Sanjay Patel  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incorrect">Incorrect</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Garcia, Maria, &amp; Sanjay Patel<br />
Reason: MLA uses the word “and,” not an ampersand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garcia, Maria and Patel, Sanjay<br />
Reason: the second author should not be inverted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garcia, Maria, Patel, Sanjay<br />
Reason: missing “and” between authors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Always use the word “and.” Even if a database export uses “&amp;,” replace it with “and” to match MLA style.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">
<h2 >Three or more authors: use “et al.” after the first author only</h2>
<p>For sources with three or more authors, MLA 9 simplifies the author field:</p>
<ol>
<li>List only the first author, inverted.</li>
<li>Add a comma.</li>
<li>Add “et al.” (with a period after “al.”).</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not list the second and third authors before “et al.” MLA 9 wants a clean, consistent approach that avoids long author lists while still giving credit. The first author still needs a full first name, not an initial.</p>
<h3 id="correct">Correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nickels, William, et al.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incorrect">Incorrect</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nickels, William, Smith, John, et al.<br />
Reason: MLA does not list additional authors before “et al.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nickels, W., et al.<br />
Reason: uses an initial instead of the full first name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>“Et al.” is not italicized in MLA Works Cited entries. Keep the punctuation exactly as shown, especially the comma before “et al.” and the period after “al.”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-find-sources-quickly">They help readers find sources quickly</h3>
<p>A Works Cited page is designed for scanning. Inverted first-author names create a consistent left margin pattern, and the alphabetical order becomes reliable. Readers can locate “Morrison” under M, not under T for “Toni.”</p>
<h3 id="they-prevent-confusion-between-similar-names">They prevent confusion between similar names</h3>
<p>Using full first names reduces ambiguity. “Smith, J.” could refer to many people, but “Smith, John David” is much more specific.</p>
<h3 id="they-keep-your-formatting-consistent-across-source-types">They keep your formatting consistent across source types</h3>
<p>MLA uses one core author system for nearly everything. Once you learn the patterns, you can apply them to books, articles, web pages, and more without reinventing your approach each time.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-detailed-explanations-correct-mla-9-author-formatting">
<h2 >Examples with detailed explanations (correct MLA 9 author formatting)</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-one-author-full-name-and-inversion">Example 1, One author (full name and inversion)</h3>
<p><strong>Correct author element:</strong><br />
Morrison, Toni</p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The name is inverted, last name first, which supports alphabetizing.<br />
- The first name is written in full, not as an initial.<br />
- No extra punctuation is added beyond the comma after the last name.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not write “Morrison, T.” even if you are trying to be brief. MLA 9 prefers the full first name.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-use-and-second-author-normal-order">Example 2, Two authors (use “and,” second author normal order)</h3>
<p><strong>Correct author element:</strong><br />
Garcia, Maria, and Sanjay Patel</p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, which determines alphabetization under “Garcia.”<br />
- The second author is written in normal order, which improves readability.<br />
- “And” is spelled out, which is the MLA standard.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not invert the second author as “Patel, Sanjay.” Only the first author is inverted in a two-author entry.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-three-or-more-authors-first-author-plus-et-al">Example 3, Three or more authors (first author plus et al.)</h3>
<p><strong>Correct author element:</strong><br />
Nickels, William, et al.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- Only the first author is listed, and that name is inverted.<br />
- “Et al.” replaces the remaining authors, keeping the entry concise.<br />
- The punctuation is correct, including the comma before “et al.” and the period after “al.”</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not list multiple authors and then add “et al.” MLA 9’s rule is first author only, then “et al.”</p>

<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-title-formatting-the-big-picture">
<h2 >MLA 9 Title Formatting: The Big Picture</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, titles do more than identify a source. They also show what kind of source it is and how it fits into a larger work. MLA uses two main formatting tools for titles, italics and quotation marks, plus one consistent capitalization style called Title Case. If you apply these rules correctly, your citations become easier to read, easier to check, and more consistent across a Works Cited list.</p>
<p>The key idea is simple. Use <strong>Title Case for every title</strong>, then choose <strong>italics or quotation marks</strong> based on whether the work is <strong>complete and standalone</strong> or <strong>short and part of a larger container</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="title-case-capitalization-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Title Case Capitalization in MLA 9</h2>
<p>MLA 9 requires <strong>Title Case</strong> for titles of sources. This applies to everything, books, articles, web pages, films, journals, and more.</p>
<h3 id="what-title-case-means">What Title Case means</h3>
<p>In Title Case, you capitalize:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>first word</strong> of the title</li>
<li>The <strong>last word</strong> of the title</li>
<li>All <strong>principal words</strong>, including  </li>
<li>nouns (Education, Climate, Novel)  </li>
<li>pronouns (She, They, Who)  </li>
<li>verbs (Explains, Running, Is)  </li>
<li>adjectives (Modern, Reluctant, Global)  </li>
<li>adverbs (Quickly, Often)  </li>
<li>subordinating conjunctions (Because, Although, While)</li>
</ul>
<p>You usually lowercase:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Articles</strong>: a, an, the  </li>
<li><strong>Coordinating conjunctions</strong>: and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet  </li>
<li><strong>Prepositions</strong>: in, on, at, by, to, of, from, with, over, under  </li>
</ul>
<p>Exception: You capitalize any of those lowercase words if they are the <strong>first or last word</strong> in the title.</p>
<h3 id="common-title-case-mistakes-to-avoid">Common Title Case mistakes to avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using sentence case</strong> (only capitalizing the first word)  </li>
<li>Incorrect: <code>"The impact of climate change"</code>  </li>
<li>Correct: <code>"The Impact of Climate Change"</code></li>
<li><strong>Capitalizing every word</strong> even small ones  </li>
<li>Incorrect: <code>"The Impact Of Climate Change"</code>  </li>
<li>Correct: <code>"The Impact of Climate Change"</code></li>
<li><strong>Forgetting to capitalize the last word</strong> when it is a preposition  </li>
<li>Correct: <code>"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"</code><br />
  The last word is capitalized because it is the last word, even though it is a major word anyway. The same rule applies if the last word is a short preposition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tips-for-title-case">Practical tips for Title Case</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the title and identify the “important” words. If the word names something, describes something, or shows action, it is usually capitalized.</li>
<li>Check the first and last word. They should always be capitalized, no matter what they are.</li>
<li>Be consistent. MLA values uniform formatting across your Works Cited list.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="italics-for-complete-works-standalone-sources">
<h2 >Italics for Complete Works (Standalone Sources)</h2>
<p>Use <strong>italics</strong> for titles of <strong>complete works</strong>, meaning works that are independent and self-contained. In MLA, these complete works often function as <strong>containers</strong> because they can hold smaller works inside them.</p>
<h3 id="what-usually-goes-in-italics">What usually goes in italics</h3>
<p>Use italics for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Books</strong></li>
<li><strong>Journals</strong> (as publications, not individual articles)</li>
<li><strong>Websites</strong> (the overall site name, not a specific page)</li>
<li><strong>Films</strong></li>
<li><strong>TV series</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This matches MLA’s logic. If you can pick up the work, subscribe to it, stream it as a whole, or visit it as a full site, it is usually a complete work.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-italicized-titles">Examples of italicized titles</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Beloved</em></li>

<p>Use quotation marks for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journal articles</strong></li>

<li><strong>Web pages</strong> (a page on a site)</li>
<li><strong>Poems</strong></li>
<li><strong>Short stories</strong></li>
<li><strong>TV episodes</strong></li>

<section class="content-section" id="never-use-both-italics-and-quotation-marks-on-the-same-title">
<h2 >Never Use Both Italics and Quotation Marks on the Same Title</h2>
<p>MLA uses formatting to communicate the role of a work. Italics signal a complete work. Quotation marks signal a part of a larger work. If you combine them, you cancel out the meaning and create a formatting error.</p>

<h2 >Examples (Correct Formatting) With Explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-journal-article-inside-a-journal">Example 1: Journal article inside a journal</h3>
<p><strong>Correct MLA title formatting (as it would appear in a citation):</strong><br />
“Modern Storytelling.” <em>Journal of Modern Arts</em>, vol. 12, no. 3, 2024, pp. 45-62.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- “Modern Storytelling” is a <strong>journal article</strong>, so it is a shorter work inside a container. It gets <strong>quotation marks</strong>.<br />
- <em>Journal of Modern Arts</em> is the <strong>journal title</strong>, a complete publication. It gets <strong>italics</strong>.<br />
- Both titles use <strong>Title Case</strong>, so major words are capitalized.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong><br />
Writers often italicize the article title by mistake. That makes the article look like a standalone publication, which it is not.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-web-page-inside-a-website">Example 2: Web page inside a website</h3>
<p><strong>Correct MLA title formatting (as it would appear in a citation):</strong><br />
“The Impact of Climate Change.” <em>National Geographic</em>, 15 May 2023, www.nationalgeographic.com.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- “The Impact of Climate Change” is a <strong>web page title</strong>, which is a shorter work within a larger site. It uses <strong>quotation marks</strong>.<br />
- <em>National Geographic</em> is the <strong>website name</strong>, which functions as the container. It uses <strong>italics</strong>.<br />
- The word “of” is lowercase because it is a preposition and it is not the first or last word. That is correct Title Case.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong><br />
People sometimes italicize the page title and forget the website name. That removes the container structure MLA relies on.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-chapter-in-a-book">Example 3: Chapter in a book</h3>
<p><strong>Correct MLA title formatting (as it would appear in a citation):</strong><br />
“Talk to Me: Engaging Reluctant Writers.” <em>Teaching Writing Today</em>, edited by Maria Chen, Riverbend Press, 2022, pp. 101-125.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- The chapter title is a <strong>part of a book</strong>, so it uses <strong>quotation marks</strong>.<br />
- The book is a <strong>complete work</strong>, so it uses <strong>italics</strong>.<br />
- Title Case is used for both titles, and major words like “Engaging,” “Reluctant,” and “Writers” are capitalized.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong><br />
Some writers put quotation marks around the book title too. That makes the book look like a smaller work, which is incorrect.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why These Rules Matter</h2>
<p>MLA formatting is not just decoration. It is a system that helps readers understand your sources quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Italics show independence.</strong> They signal that the work stands on its own.</li>
<li><strong>Quotation marks show dependence.</strong> They signal that the work belongs inside a larger source.</li>
<li><strong>Title Case creates consistency.</strong> Readers can scan your Works Cited list and recognize titles immediately.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="overview-why-mla-date-rules-matter">
<h2 >Overview, why MLA date rules matter</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, dates are not just “extra details.” They help readers identify the exact version of a source, distinguish between similar publications, and locate the item quickly. MLA also uses a consistent order for citation elements. When you place the date in the correct spot and use the correct format, your Works Cited entry becomes easier to scan, easier to verify, and more credible.</p>
<p>MLA date formatting has four common areas where writers make mistakes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Where the date goes in the citation</strong>, especially in relation to the publisher, pages, and URLs.  </li>
<li><strong>How to format a full date</strong>, using Day Month Year with an abbreviated month and no commas.  </li>
<li><strong>How to handle URLs</strong>, including removing http:// or https:// in most cases.  </li>
<li><strong>How to format DOIs</strong>, which are often the best permanent link for scholarly articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sections below explain each rule in plain language, with examples and practical tips.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="date-placement-in-mla-9-after-the-publisher">
<h2 >Date placement in MLA 9, after the publisher</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-rule">The core rule</h3>
<p><strong>Place the publication date after the publisher and before page numbers or the URL.</strong> This is the standard sequence in MLA’s “container” model. In other words, once you write the publisher, you add a comma, then the date, then another comma, then pages or the URL.</p>
<p>This matches MLA 9 guidance on element order. It also aligns with this rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers or URL</strong> (MLA9-R3.1)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Readers expect MLA citations to follow a predictable pattern. If the date is placed after pages, it can look like the date belongs to something else, or it can slow down the reader who is trying to confirm your source. Correct placement also prevents a very common MLA error, treating the date like APA and putting it right after the author.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting the date after page numbers.  </li>
<li>Putting the date in parentheses after the author’s name.  </li>
<li>Using a period after the publisher when a comma is needed to continue the publication details.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="day-month-year-format-abbreviated-months-no-commas">
<h2 >Day Month Year format, abbreviated months, no commas</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-rule">The core rule</h3>
<p>For sources with a specific publication date, MLA 9 uses <strong>Day Month Year</strong>, with the month abbreviated, and <strong>no commas</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>5 Feb. 2024</strong>  </li>
<li>Correct: <strong>28 Dec. 2025</strong>  </li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Feb. 5, 2024</strong> (wrong order and includes a comma)  </li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>2024-02-05</strong> (ISO format, not MLA)</li>
</ul>
<p>This matches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date format: Day Month Year, abbreviated month, no commas</strong> (MLA9-R3.2)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="month-abbreviations-in-mla-9">Month abbreviations in MLA 9</h3>
<p>MLA abbreviates months as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, June, July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that <strong>May, June, and July are not abbreviated</strong>. Also note <strong>Sept.</strong> includes a period.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>MLA’s Day Month Year format is used widely in international contexts and avoids confusion when day and month could be swapped. The lack of commas is part of MLA’s clean, minimal punctuation style.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are copying a date from a website, you will often see “February 5, 2024.” Convert it to <strong>5 Feb. 2024</strong>.  </li>
<li>If a source lists only a month and year, MLA often allows just what is available. If your instructor expects a specific approach, follow their guidance, but do not invent a day.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="year-only-dates-no-parentheses">
<h2 >Year only dates, no parentheses</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-rule">The core rule</h3>
<p>If the source only provides a year, use <strong>just the year</strong>, followed by a period. Do not use parentheses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>2024.</strong>  </li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>(2024)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This matches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year-only format: just the year, no parentheses</strong> (MLA9-R3.3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Parentheses around the year are an APA habit. MLA’s goal is a consistent, readable sentence-like entry in the Works Cited list. The period after the year signals that the date element is complete.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="no-date-available-omit-the-date-entirely">
<h2 >No date available, omit the date entirely</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-rule">The core rule</h3>
<p>If no publication date is available, <strong>omit the date element</strong>. Do not use “n.d.” and do not write “no date.”</p>
<p>This matches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NO DATE available: omit date element, do not use n.d.</strong> (MLA9-R3.4)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>MLA prefers accuracy over placeholders. Adding “n.d.” can imply a standardized label that MLA does not use, and it can make your citation look inconsistent with MLA style.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the page has no date but is likely to change, consider adding an access date, which MLA allows and often recommends for changing web content.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="access-dates-when-to-use-them-and-where-they-go">
<h2 >Access dates, when to use them and where they go</h2>
<h3 id="the-core-rule">The core rule</h3>
<p>An access date is optional, but recommended for content that changes frequently. Format it as:</p>
<p><strong>Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Place it at the end of the entry, after the URL.</p>
<p>This matches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access dates: "Accessed Day Month Year" at end</strong> (MLA9-R3.5)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>If a page is updated often, your reader may not see the same information you saw. An access date helps explain that difference and shows when you consulted the material.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing the access date before the URL.  </li>
<li>Leaving off the word “Accessed.”  </li>
<li>Using the wrong date format, like “Feb. 5, 2024.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="urls-in-mla-9-remove-http-and-https">
<h2 >URLs in MLA 9, remove http:// and https://</h2>
<h3 id="the-basic-practice">The basic practice</h3>
<p>In MLA 9 Works Cited entries, you generally include the URL <strong>without</strong> the protocol, meaning you typically drop <strong>http://</strong> and <strong>https://</strong>. This keeps citations cleaner and easier to read.</p>
<p>Example format:<br />
- Correct style: <strong>www.example.com/article</strong><br />
- Not preferred in MLA style: <strong>https://www.example.com/article</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>MLA aims for a streamlined citation. Most readers can reach the source without seeing the protocol, and removing it reduces clutter.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Copy the URL from your browser, then delete the protocol manually. Keep the rest of the URL exactly as it appears, including any important page identifiers.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="doi-formatting-in-mla-9">
<h2 >DOI formatting in MLA 9</h2>
<h3 id="the-basic-practice">The basic practice</h3>
<p>A DOI is often better than a URL for scholarly articles because it is designed to be stable over time. In MLA 9, you can present a DOI as a DOI link, commonly in this form:</p>
<p><strong>doi:10.xxxx/xxxxx</strong><br />
or<br />
<strong>https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx</strong></p>
<p>Many instructors and libraries prefer the <strong>https://doi.org/</strong> version because it works as a direct link. Whichever form you use, be consistent across your Works Cited list.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Journal websites change. Database links can break. A DOI is meant to remain the same even if the article moves to a different web location.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you have both a DOI and a long database permalink, use the DOI. It is usually shorter and more reliable.</p>

Nguyen, Linh. “Mapping Urban Heat Islands.” <em>Journal of Environmental Studies</em>, vol. 18, no. 2, Greenfield Press, <strong>2024</strong>, pp. 45-58.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The <strong>publisher</strong> appears before the <strong>date</strong>, and the date appears before <strong>page numbers</strong>, which follows MLA9-R3.1.<br />
- The date is <strong>year only</strong>, which is appropriate when the journal issue is identified by volume and number and does not require a specific day and month, which follows MLA9-R3.3.<br />
- The year ends with a comma here because more publication details follow, specifically the page range.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not write: Greenfield Press. pp. 45-58, 2024. That places the date after pages, which breaks MLA order.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The date uses <strong>Day Month Year</strong> with an abbreviated month and no commas, which follows MLA9-R3.2.<br />
- The date comes <strong>after the publisher</strong> and <strong>before the URL</strong>, which follows MLA9-R3.1.<br />
- The URL is shown <strong>without https://</strong>, which matches common MLA 9 practice for cleaner citations.<br />
- The access date is placed at the <strong>end</strong>, after the URL, and begins with “Accessed,” which follows MLA9-R3.5.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not write: Feb. 5, 2024. That is not MLA date order and it uses a comma.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The date is <strong>year only</strong>, which fits many journal citations, and it is not in parentheses, which follows MLA9-R3.3.<br />

- The DOI is included as a stable identifier, which is especially useful for academic sources.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not place the DOI before the date. In MLA, the date belongs with the publication details and should appear before the location element, which can be a URL or DOI.</p>

<h3 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Convert web dates into <strong>Day Month Year</strong> right away, then you do not forget later.  </li>
<li>Use <strong>year only</strong> when that is all the source provides.  </li>
<li>If there is <strong>no date</strong>, omit it. Consider adding an access date if the content changes.  </li>
<li>Prefer a <strong>DOI</strong> for scholarly articles when available.  </li>
<li>Remove <strong>http://</strong> and <strong>https://</strong> from URLs unless your instructor requires otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting the date in parentheses, which is not MLA.  </li>
<li>Using commas inside the date, like “5 Feb., 2024.”  </li>
<li>Writing American style dates, like “Feb. 5, 2024.”  </li>
<li>Placing the access date before the URL.  </li>
<li>Leaving “n.d.” in the citation instead of omitting the date.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, paste one or two draft citations you are working on, and I can correct the date placement, URL, and DOI formatting to match MLA 9 exactly.</p>

<h2 >In-Text Citations</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-mla-9-in-text-citations-do">
<h2 >What MLA 9 in-text citations do</h2>
<p>MLA 9 in-text citations tell readers two things quickly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is responsible for the information, usually the author.</li>
<li>Where to find it in the source, usually the page number.</li>
</ol>
<p>They work together with your Works Cited page. The in-text citation points to the full entry, and the Works Cited entry provides complete publication details.</p>
<p>MLA in-text citations are designed to be brief so they do not interrupt your writing. That is why MLA uses the author and page format and leaves out extra labels like p. or pp. in parentheses.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="two-main-styles-parenthetical-and-narrative">
<h2 >Two main styles, parenthetical and narrative</h2>
<p>MLA 9 gives you two common ways to cite sources in the body of your paper. The choice depends on how you build the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="parenthetical-citations">Parenthetical citations</h3>
<p>A parenthetical citation puts the author and page number in parentheses, usually at the end of the sentence, before the period.</p>
<p><strong>Basic format</strong><br />
- (Author Page)</p>
<p><strong>Key punctuation and spacing rules</strong><br />
- Use a space between the author name and the page number.<br />
- Do not use a comma between the author and the page number.<br />
- Do not use p. or pp. in the in-text citation.</p>
<p>This matches MLA guidance that in-text citations use only author and page number, with no p. or pp., and no comma between them.</p>
<h3 id="narrative-citations">Narrative citations</h3>
<p>A narrative citation names the author in the sentence itself. Then you place only the page number in parentheses, usually right after the quoted or paraphrased material.</p>
<p><strong>Basic format</strong><br />
- Author writes that ... (Page).</p>
<p>Narrative citations often read more smoothly because the author name becomes part of your sentence, and the parentheses stay minimal.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-author-page-format-and-why-there-is-no-p-or-pp">
<h2 >The author page format, and why there is no p. or pp.</h2>
<p>MLA in-text citations use the author page format, like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Morrison 42)</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA does not use p. or pp. in parentheses because the page number is already understood as a page reference in this system. Adding p. or pp. is considered unnecessary and is a common formatting error.</p>
<p>Also, MLA does not use a comma between the author and the page number. The space alone signals the relationship clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Correct</strong><br />
- (Morrison 42)</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect</strong><br />
- (Morrison, 42)<br />
- (Morrison, p. 42)<br />
- (Morrison pp. 42-43)</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="where-the-in-text-citation-goes-in-the-sentence">
<h2 >Where the in-text citation goes in the sentence</h2>
<p>In most cases, place the parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence, after the quotation or paraphrase, and before the final period.</p>
<p><strong>Example placement</strong><br />
- The character’s memory is shaped by trauma and community pressure (Morrison 42).</p>
<p>If you use a block quote, the citation comes after the final punctuation of the block, not before it. The same author page formatting applies.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="sources-without-page-numbers">
<h2 >Sources without page numbers</h2>
<p>Many sources do not have stable page numbers, for example websites, some ebooks, streaming videos, and social media posts. MLA’s goal stays the same, help readers locate the information. When page numbers are unavailable, you adjust by using what the source provides.</p>
<h3 id="if-there-are-no-page-numbers-omit-the-page-number">If there are no page numbers, omit the page number</h3>
<p>If a source has no page numbers, use only the author name in the in-text citation.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Nguyen)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you name the author in the sentence, you may not need parentheses at all, unless you need another locator.</p>
<p>This approach keeps the citation accurate. You should not invent page numbers or use the PDF page count unless the source itself displays those pages as part of the document.</p>
<h3 id="use-another-locator-when-it-helps-readers-find-the-passage">Use another locator when it helps readers find the passage</h3>
<p>If the source includes stable locators, you can use them to help readers. The specific locator depends on the medium.</p>
<p>Common options include:<br />
- Chapter numbers for books or ebooks that label chapters.<br />
- Section headings for web pages.<br />
- Timestamps for videos.</p>
<p>Keep the locator brief and clear. If you use a heading, you can name it in your sentence so the citation stays readable.</p>
<p>If your instructor requires a specific locator style, follow that guidance, since MLA allows flexibility when page numbers are not available.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-1-parenthetical-citation-for-a-print-book-author-page">
<h2 >Example 1, parenthetical citation for a print book (author page)</h2>
<p><strong>Sentence with citation</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Sethe’s past repeatedly interrupts the present, shaping what the characters can accept as truth (Morrison 42).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- It uses the author page format, Morrison and 42.<br />
- There is a space between Morrison and 42.<br />
- There is no comma.<br />
- There is no p. or pp., which MLA does not use in in-text citations.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you cite the same author multiple times in a paragraph, you still need citations where a reader might lose track of what information came from the source. A good habit is to cite each sentence that relies on the source unless it is unmistakably part of the same continuous paraphrase.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-narrative-citation-for-a-journal-article-author-named-in-the-sentence">
<h2 >Example 2, narrative citation for a journal article (author named in the sentence)</h2>
<p><strong>Sentence with citation</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Patel argues that small changes in classroom routines can significantly improve student participation (118).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author’s name, Patel, appears in the sentence, so the parentheses contain only the page number.<br />
- The page number is given without p. or pp.<br />
- The citation is placed before the period, which is standard for most MLA sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Writers sometimes repeat the author in both places, like Patel ... (Patel 118). That is not wrong, but it is usually unnecessary. Narrative style is meant to avoid repetition.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-web-page-with-no-page-numbers-author-only-plus-a-helpful-locator">
<h2 >Example 3, web page with no page numbers (author only, plus a helpful locator)</h2>
<p><strong>Sentence with citation</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>In the section titled “Data Privacy Basics,” Chen explains that consent is meaningful only when users understand what they are agreeing to (Chen).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The source has no page numbers, so the citation uses the author only.<br />
- The sentence itself provides a locator, the section title, which helps readers find the passage without forcing an awkward citation format.<br />
- It avoids making up page numbers, which would mislead readers.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If there is no author, MLA often uses a shortened title in the in-text citation. If you are working with a source that truly has no author listed, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks for an article or web page, or italicized for a standalone work. Make sure it matches the first element of the Works Cited entry.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<h3 id="they-protect-credibility-and-prevent-accidental-plagiarism">They protect credibility and prevent accidental plagiarism</h3>
<p>Clear in-text citations show which ideas are yours and which come from sources. Even when you paraphrase, you still need to cite because the underlying idea is not original to your paper.</p>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-verify-your-claims-quickly">They help readers verify your claims quickly</h3>
<p>MLA’s author page system lets a reader move from your sentence to the exact place in the source with minimal effort. Leaving out extra labels keeps the signal clean and consistent.</p>
<h3 id="they-create-consistency-across-your-paper">They create consistency across your paper</h3>
<p>Small punctuation rules, like no comma and no p. or pp., may seem minor, but they make your citations uniform. Uniform citations are easier to scan, easier to grade, and easier to trust.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the author name in your sentence when it improves flow, then use only the page number in parentheses.</li>
<li>Check that the name in your in-text citation matches the first element of the Works Cited entry. If the Works Cited entry begins with an organization, use that organization in the in-text citation.</li>
<li>For sources without pages, focus on clarity. Use author only, and add a chapter, section name, or timestamp in the sentence when it will help readers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Adding p. or pp. in parentheses. MLA in-text citations do not use them.</li>

<h2 >✅ Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Use this checklist to verify your citations before submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
