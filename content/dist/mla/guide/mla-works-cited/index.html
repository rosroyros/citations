<h2 >Introduction</h2>
<p>If you have ever stared at your Works Cited page and thought, “Why does this feel so picky,” you are not alone. The MLA works cited section is one of those places where small formatting choices carry a lot of weight, and it can be frustrating when you know your sources are solid but your MLA bibliography still gets marked down for details like spacing, order, or name formatting. This guide is written to meet you where you are, especially if you are using an APA citation guide for other parts of your writing life and you just need the MLA 9 works cited page rules to be clear, practical, and easy to apply.</p>
<p>You will learn how the works cited format is supposed to look on the page, and why those rules exist. We will walk through the basics that instructors expect, including how to alphabetize entries correctly, what to do when there is no author, and how to handle multiple entries from the same author without second guessing yourself. Alphabetization is a common stress point, especially when titles begin with “A,” “An,” or “The,” or when you are sorting entries that start with an organization name instead of a person. You will also get straightforward guidance on hanging indent formatting, since it is easy to do incorrectly and it can make an otherwise correct list look wrong at a glance.</p>
<p>Because MLA 9 emphasizes clarity in authorship, this guide will also help you avoid a few frequent name related pitfalls. You will see how to format author names with full first names rather than initials, how to invert the first author’s name for alphabetical ordering, and how to format two author and three or more author entries using “and” and “et al.” the MLA way. If you are juggling several sources by the same writer, you will find specific steps for keeping those entries consistent and easy to scan.</p>
<p>By the end, you should be able to build an MLA works cited page that looks polished, reads cleanly, and follows MLA 9 expectations without the trial and error that usually makes this process so annoying.</p>

<h2 >Understanding MLA 9th Edition</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-philosophy-of-mla-works-cited-entries">
<h2 >Core philosophy of MLA Works Cited entries</h2>
<p>MLA 9 focuses on helping readers find your sources quickly and reliably. Instead of memorizing dozens of separate citation “recipes,” MLA uses a small set of core elements that can be applied to almost any source. The Works Cited page is built around two goals.</p>
<p>First, <strong>credit</strong>. You show who created the work, what it is called, and where it came from. This supports academic honesty and makes your writing trustworthy.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>traceability</strong>. A reader should be able to locate the exact version you used. That is why MLA emphasizes details like containers, publishers, dates, and URLs or DOIs. When a source exists in multiple places, the citation should guide the reader to your specific pathway to it.</p>
<p>A practical way to remember MLA’s philosophy is this. Your citation should answer, in order, “What did you use,” “Who made it,” and “Where did you find it,” using consistent formatting so a reader can scan a Works Cited list easily.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-elements-framework-in-mla-9">
<h2 >The “core elements” framework in MLA 9</h2>
<p>MLA citations are assembled from common building blocks. The most used core elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of source</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of container</strong></li>
<li><strong>Other contributors</strong> (editors, translators, performers, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number</strong> (volume, issue, season, episode)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong></li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> (page numbers for print, or DOI, URL, or database permalink for online)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every entry uses every element. You include what is relevant and available, then place elements in MLA’s standard order. The key concept is that the same logic works for a book, an article, a video, or an interview.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-container-system-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters">
<h2 >The container system, what it is and why it matters</h2>
<p>A <strong>container</strong> is the larger whole that holds the source you actually used. Many sources are not standalone. For example, a journal article is contained within a journal, and a poem might be contained within an anthology. A streaming episode is contained within a series, and that series might be contained within a platform.</p>
<p>MLA 9 uses containers because it reflects how people actually access information. You often do not “use a journal” in the abstract. You use an article inside a journal, and you may reach it through a database. Containers show that path.</p>
<h3 id="container-1-and-container-2">Container 1 and container 2</h3>
<p>MLA often involves <strong>two layers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Container 1</strong>: The immediate place where the source appears (a journal, an edited book, a website, a TV series).</li>
<li><strong>Container 2</strong>: A larger system that provides access (a database like JSTOR, a platform like Netflix, a library catalog, an app).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every source has two containers, but many online sources do. Including the container helps readers replicate your access route.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-container-system-improves-your-works-cited-page">Why the container system improves your Works Cited page</h3>
<ul>
<li>It prevents vague citations. “Found online” is not enough, but “in <em>Journal Name</em>, accessed via JSTOR” is clear.</li>
<li>It clarifies versions. The same article might appear on a publisher website and in a database, sometimes with different page numbering or metadata.</li>
<li>It supports credibility. A reader can see the publication context, not just a raw link.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-that-shape-works-cited-entries">
<h2 >Author rules that shape Works Cited entries</h2>
<p>Your rules emphasize author formatting, which is one of the most visible parts of MLA style.</p>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials-mla9-r11">Full first names, not initials (MLA9-R1.1)</h3>
<p>In this guide, author names must use <strong>full first names</strong>, not initials. The purpose is clarity and respect for the author’s identity. Initials can create confusion when multiple authors share a last name and first initial.</p>
<h3 id="invert-only-the-first-author-mla9-r12">Invert only the first author (MLA9-R1.2)</h3>
<p>The first author is listed as <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>. This supports alphabetizing the Works Cited page by last name.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted-mla9-r13">Two authors use “and,” second author not inverted (MLA9-R1.3)</h3>
<p>For two authors, MLA uses <strong>and</strong>, not an ampersand. Only the first author is inverted.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-mla9-r14">Three or more authors use “et al.” (MLA9-R1.4)</h3>
<p>List the first author, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list additional authors before et al.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title-mla9-r15">No author, start with the title (MLA9-R1.5)</h3>
<p>If there is no author, begin with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” The title becomes the first element, and alphabetization ignores A, An, and The.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-correct-formatting-and-detailed-explanations">
<h2 >Examples with correct formatting and detailed explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-journal-article-in-a-database-two-containers">Example 1, journal article in a database (two containers)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong><br />
Garcia, Maria Elena, and Sanjay Patel. “Urban Heat Islands and Public Health.” <em>Journal of Environmental Studies</em>, vol. 42, no. 3, 2023, pp. 155-178. <em>JSTOR</em>, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.0000/example.</p>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- <strong>Authors</strong> follow the rules. The first author is inverted and uses a full first name. The second author is in normal order, joined with <strong>and</strong> (MLA9-R1.1, MLA9-R1.2, MLA9-R1.3).<br />
- The <strong>article title</strong> is in quotation marks because it is a shorter work within a larger publication.<br />
- <em>Journal of Environmental Studies</em> is <strong>container 1</strong> and is italicized.<br />
- Volume, issue, year, and page range help readers locate the article in print or PDF form.<br />
- <em>JSTOR</em> is <strong>container 2</strong>. The database name is italicized, followed by a stable link.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Using an ampersand: “Garcia, Maria Elena, &amp; Sanjay Patel” violates MLA9-R1.3.<br />
- Inverting the second author: “Garcia, Maria Elena, and Patel, Sanjay” is incorrect.<br />
- Dropping the database container, which makes it harder for a reader to find your exact access route.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-chapter-in-an-edited-book-container-logic-without-a-database">Example 2, chapter in an edited book (container logic without a database)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong><br />
Morrison, Toni. “Memory and Place.” <em>Contemporary Literary Perspectives</em>, edited by Daniel Robert Kim, Riverbend Press, 2020, pp. 45-62.</p>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- The author name is inverted and uses the full first name (MLA9-R1.1, MLA9-R1.2).<br />
- The chapter title is in quotation marks because it is part of a larger book.<br />
- The edited book title is the <strong>container</strong>, italicized.<br />
- The editor is listed as an <strong>other contributor</strong>, introduced with “edited by.”<br />
- Publisher, year, and page range show exactly where the chapter appears.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Treating the chapter like a standalone book and italicizing the chapter title. In MLA, the chapter is in quotation marks, the book is italicized.<br />
- Omitting page numbers, which are a key “location” element for print sources.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-web-page-with-no-author-start-with-title">Example 3, web page with no author (start with title)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong><br />
“Climate Change Effects.” <em>Nature Today</em>, 18 Apr. 2024, https://www.naturetoday.org/climate-change-effects.</p>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- With <strong>no author</strong>, the entry starts with the title (MLA9-R1.5). You do not insert “Anonymous” or “n.d.”<br />
- The page title is in quotation marks because it is a shorter work within a website.<br />
- <em>Nature Today</em> is the <strong>container</strong> and is italicized.<br />
- The date and URL help readers find the specific page.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Starting with the date, which disrupts alphabetizing.<br />
- Using “n.d.” when no date is available. If there is no date, you omit it rather than adding a placeholder.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-for-building-works-cited-entries">
<h2 >Practical tips for building Works Cited entries</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build citations from the source outward.</strong> Start with the specific item you used, then identify what contains it.</li>
<li><strong>Use the punctuation as structure.</strong> MLA punctuation is not decorative. Commas and periods separate elements so readers can scan quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Choose the most stable location.</strong> Prefer DOIs, stable links, or permalinks over long tracking URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Stay consistent with names.</strong> Follow the full first name requirement in this guide, and keep the first author inverted.</li>
<li><strong>Do a final “find it” test.</strong> Pretend you are a reader. Could you locate the source using only your citation?</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-real-academic-writing">
<h2 >Why these rules matter in real academic writing</h2>
<p>These rules are not just formatting preferences. They protect the usefulness of your Works Cited page. Full names reduce ambiguity, consistent author order supports alphabetization, and the container system shows the publication context and access pathway. When your citations are clear and consistent, your argument becomes easier to trust, and your reader can verify your evidence without frustration.</p>

<h2 >Author Formatting Rules</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-name-formatting-in-mla-9-the-core-pattern">
<h2 >Author Name Formatting in MLA 9: The Core Pattern</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, the author element is usually the first piece of information in a Works Cited entry, so it sets the tone for everything that follows. MLA uses author names to help readers do two things quickly, identify who created the work and find the entry easily in an alphabetized Works Cited list. Because the Works Cited list is organized by the first element of each entry, MLA has specific rules for how names appear, especially for the first author.</p>
<p>MLA 9 emphasizes clarity and consistency. That is why it prefers full first names rather than initials, and it uses name inversion for the first author only. Once you learn the basic patterns, you can apply them to almost any source type, including books, articles, websites, and videos.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="use-full-first-names-not-initials">
<h2 >Use Full First Names, Not Initials</h2>
<h3 id="what-mla-9-expects">What MLA 9 expects</h3>
<p>MLA 9 requires full first names when they are available. This means you should write “Toni Morrison,” not “T. Morrison” or “T. E. Morrison.” Full names make it easier for readers to identify the correct person, especially when multiple authors share similar initials or last names.</p>
<h3 id="correct-and-incorrect-forms">Correct and incorrect forms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Morrison, Toni</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Morrison, T.</strong> (initial used instead of full first name)</li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Morrison, T. E.</strong> (initials used for first and middle names)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If your source lists the author as initials but you can confirm the full name from a reliable location, such as the publisher page or the author’s official website, use the full name in your Works Cited entry. If you truly cannot find the full first name, avoid guessing. Use what the source provides, but do not invent names.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="invert-the-first-authors-name-last-first-middle">
<h2 >Invert the First Author’s Name (Last, First Middle)</h2>
<h3 id="the-rule">The rule</h3>
<p>In MLA Works Cited entries, the first author’s name is inverted. You write the last name first, then a comma, then the first name, and then the middle name if it is given.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Last name, First name Middle name</p>
<p>This inversion is not just a style preference. It supports alphabetization. When each entry begins with the author’s last name, readers can scan the list quickly and locate sources by surname.</p>
<h3 id="example-formats">Example formats</h3>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Smith, John David</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>John David Smith</strong> (not inverted, makes alphabetizing harder)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Only the first author is inverted. This is one of the most common places students make mistakes, especially when there are two authors.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">
<h2 >Two Authors: Use “and,” Second Author Not Inverted</h2>
<h3 id="the-rule">The rule</h3>
<p>For a work with two authors, list them in the order they appear in the source. Invert the first author’s name, then add a comma, then the word <strong>and</strong>, then list the second author in normal order.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Last name, First name, and First name Last name</p>
<p>MLA prefers the word <strong>and</strong> rather than an ampersand because it is formal and consistent with academic prose.</p>
<h3 id="correct-and-incorrect-forms">Correct and incorrect forms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Garcia, Maria, and Sanjay Patel</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Garcia, Maria, &amp; Sanjay Patel</strong> (ampersand used)</li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Garcia, Maria and Patel, Sanjay</strong> (second author incorrectly inverted)</li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Garcia, Maria, Patel, Sanjay</strong> (missing “and”)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>A quick check is to look at the second author. If you see a comma inside the second author name, you probably inverted it by mistake.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author">
<h2 >Three or More Authors: Use “et al.” After the First Author</h2>
<h3 id="the-rule">The rule</h3>
<p>For three or more authors, MLA 9 simplifies the author element. List only the first author, inverted, then add a comma, then <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the second and third authors before et al.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Last name, First name, et al.</p>
<p>This rule keeps entries readable and prevents long author lists from dominating the citation. It still gives credit by naming the first author and indicating there are additional contributors.</p>
<h3 id="correct-and-incorrect-forms">Correct and incorrect forms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Nickels, William, et al.</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Nickels, William, Smith, John, et al.</strong> (lists extra authors before et al.)</li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Nickels, W., et al.</strong> (initial used instead of full first name)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Remember the punctuation. MLA uses a comma before <strong>et al.</strong> and includes the period after <strong>al.</strong> because it abbreviates a Latin word meaning “others.”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-detailed-explanations-correct-formatting">
<h2 >Examples With Detailed Explanations (Correct Formatting)</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-one-author-full-name-inverted">Example 1: One author, full name, inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Correct author element:</strong><br />
<strong>Morrison, Toni</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, last name first.<br />
- The first name is written in full, not as an initial.<br />
- This format helps readers locate Morrison under M in the Works Cited list.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong><br />
Writing <strong>Morrison, T.</strong> looks shorter, but it reduces clarity and does not follow MLA 9 guidance when the full name is known.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-and-second-author-in-normal-order">Example 2: Two authors, “and,” second author in normal order</h3>
<p><strong>Correct author element:</strong><br />
<strong>Garcia, Maria, and Sanjay Patel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, “Garcia, Maria.”<br />
- MLA uses <strong>and</strong> rather than an ampersand.<br />
- The second author is not inverted, it stays as “Sanjay Patel.”<br />
- The order matches the source, which matters because it reflects how the work credits authorship.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid:</strong><br />
- Using <strong>&amp;</strong> instead of <strong>and</strong>.<br />
- Inverting the second author, which creates an inconsistent and incorrect pattern.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-three-or-more-authors-first-author-plus-et-al">Example 3: Three or more authors, first author plus “et al.”</h3>
<p><strong>Correct author element:</strong><br />
<strong>Nickels, William, et al.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted and uses a full first name.<br />
- MLA shortens the list to keep the citation clean and consistent.<br />
- The comma before <strong>et al.</strong> is required.<br />
- The period after <strong>al.</strong> is required.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong><br />
Do not write <strong>Nickels, William, Smith, John, et al.</strong> MLA 9 does not want extra names inserted before et al. Once you use et al., you stop listing authors.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why These Rules Matter</h2>
<p>These author formatting rules are not random. They solve practical problems that show up in real research writing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>They support easy searching and scanning.</strong> Inversion makes alphabetizing predictable. Readers can quickly find an author’s last name without decoding different name styles.</li>
<li><strong>They reduce confusion between similar names.</strong> Full first names help distinguish authors who share initials or last names.</li>
<li><strong>They keep citations readable.</strong> Using et al. prevents citations from becoming long and distracting, especially in sources with many collaborators.</li>
<li><strong>They show academic care.</strong> Accurate author formatting signals that you handled sources responsibly, which strengthens credibility.</li>

<h2 >Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls Checklist</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy the author name carefully from the source, then adjust it to MLA format.</li>
<li>Check whether the work has one author, two authors, or three or more. The formatting changes immediately based on that count.</li>
<li>Use full first names when available. Look at the title page of a book, the byline of an article, or the “About” section on a credible site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using initials instead of full first names.</li>
<li>Forgetting to invert the first author.</li>
<li>Inverting the second author in a two author work.</li>
<li>Using an ampersand instead of the word <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li>Listing multiple authors and then adding et al. anyway.</li>
<li>Forgetting the comma before et al., or forgetting the period in <strong>al.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quick-reference-summary">Quick Reference Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>One author:</strong> Last, First Middle  </li>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> Last, First, and First Last  </li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors:</strong> Last, First, et al.  </li>
<li><strong>Full first names:</strong> Use them when available, avoid initials</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, I can apply these rules to your specific sources, you can paste a few author lines or screenshots of title pages and I will format the author element correctly.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-title-formatting-overview">
<h2 >MLA 9 Title Formatting Overview</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, title formatting does two jobs at once. It shows readers what kind of source you used, and it helps them find that source quickly. MLA relies on a simple visual system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title Case capitalization</strong> for all titles.</li>
<li><strong>Italics</strong> for <strong>complete, standalone works</strong> and most <strong>containers</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Quotation marks</strong> for <strong>shorter works</strong> that appear inside a larger work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these rules consistently, your citations become easier to scan, your Works Cited list looks professional, and your reader can tell at a glance whether you are referring to a whole work or a part of one.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="title-case-capitalization-use-for-all-titles">
<h2 >Title Case Capitalization (Use for All Titles)</h2>
<p>MLA 9 requires <strong>Title Case</strong> for <strong>every title</strong>, whether it is a book, article, web page, film, or anything else. Title Case means you capitalize the first and last words and all major words in between.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-capitalize">What to capitalize</h3>
<p>Capitalize:<br />
- The <strong>first word</strong> of the title and subtitle<br />
- The <strong>last word</strong> of the title and subtitle<br />
- All <strong>major words</strong>, such as:<br />
  - nouns (History, Climate, Students)<br />
  - pronouns (They, Our, Who)<br />
  - verbs (Is, Writing, Understand)<br />
  - adjectives (Modern, Global, Reluctant)<br />
  - adverbs (Quickly, Carefully)</p>
<h3 id="what-to-keep-lowercase">What to keep lowercase</h3>
<p>Lowercase these words unless they are the first or last word:<br />
- Articles: <strong>a, an, the</strong><br />
- Coordinating conjunctions: <strong>and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet</strong><br />
- Prepositions: <strong>in, on, of, to, at, by, for</strong>, and similar short connecting words</p>
<h3 id="why-title-case-matters">Why Title Case matters</h3>
<p>Title Case is not just a style preference. It creates consistency across your Works Cited list. It also prevents confusion, especially with web sources where titles often appear in sentence case on the page. MLA formatting may not match the site’s styling, and that is normal. In MLA, you convert titles to MLA Title Case.</p>
<h3 id="common-title-case-mistakes-to-avoid">Common Title Case mistakes to avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using sentence case, for example: “The impact of climate change”</li>
<li>Capitalizing every word, including short words that should be lowercase</li>
<li>Forgetting to capitalize the last word when it is a preposition, for example: “A Study of What We Believe in” should capitalize “In” because it is the last word</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="italics-for-complete-works-standalone-sources-and-containers">
<h2 >Italics for Complete Works (Standalone Sources and Containers)</h2>
<p>Use <strong>italics</strong> for a <strong>complete work</strong>. A complete work is something that can stand on its own, even if it contains smaller parts. In MLA terms, many complete works also function as <strong>containers</strong>, meaning they hold shorter works inside them.</p>
<h3 id="works-that-usually-take-italics">Works that usually take italics</h3>
<p>Italics are used for:<br />
- <strong>Books</strong><br />
- <strong>Journals</strong> (the journal title, not the article title)<br />
- <strong>Websites</strong> (the website name, not the web page title)<br />
- <strong>Films</strong><br />
- <strong>TV series</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-italics-are-used">Why italics are used</h3>
<p>Italics signal that the title refers to a full, independent work. This helps readers distinguish between a whole book and one chapter, or between a whole website and one specific page.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>A quick way to decide is to ask, “Could I hold this in my hand as a complete item, or could it reasonably exist as a complete publication by itself?” If yes, it is often italicized.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quotation-marks-for-shorter-works-parts-of-a-larger-container">
<h2 >Quotation Marks for Shorter Works (Parts of a Larger Container)</h2>
<p>Use <strong>quotation marks</strong> for a <strong>shorter work</strong> that appears inside a larger work. These are items that are not usually published alone. They depend on a container for context.</p>
<h3 id="works-that-usually-take-quotation-marks">Works that usually take quotation marks</h3>
<p>Quotation marks are used for:<br />
- <strong>Article titles</strong> (journal, magazine, newspaper)<br />
- <strong>Chapter titles</strong> in a book<br />
- <strong>Web page titles</strong> on a website<br />
- <strong>Poems</strong> (when cited as a poem within a collection or on a site)<br />
- <strong>Short stories</strong><br />
- <strong>Episodes</strong> of a TV series</p>
<h3 id="why-quotation-marks-are-used">Why quotation marks are used</h3>
<p>Quotation marks show that the title is a piece of something bigger. This is especially important in MLA because citations often include both the shorter work and its container. The formatting helps the reader see the structure.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Ask, “Is this a section, episode, chapter, or page that lives inside a bigger titled source?” If yes, use quotation marks for the shorter part, then italics for the container.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="never-use-both-italics-and-quotation-marks-on-the-same-title">
<h2 >Never Use Both Italics and Quotation Marks on the Same Title</h2>
<p>MLA 9 does not allow double formatting like italicizing a title and placing it in quotation marks. This is redundant and incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-rule-matters">Why this rule matters</h3>
<p>Using both formats makes it unclear whether the item is a complete work or a part of a larger work. MLA’s system depends on the reader being able to interpret the formatting quickly.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Writers sometimes add quotation marks for emphasis or copy formatting from a website that uses both. In MLA, you must choose one format based on the type of work.</p>

<h2 >Examples (Correct Formatting With Explanations)</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-journal-article-in-a-journal">
<h2 >Example 1: Journal Article in a Journal</h2>
<p><strong>Correct MLA title formatting (titles only):</strong><br />
- Article title: <strong>"Modern Storytelling"</strong><br />
- Journal title: <em>Journal of Modern Arts</em></p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Modern Storytelling"</strong> is a <strong>shorter work</strong>. It is part of a larger publication, the journal, so it uses <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Journal of Modern Arts</em> is a <strong>complete work</strong> and a <strong>container</strong> for many articles, so it uses <strong>italics</strong>.</li>
<li>Both titles use <strong>Title Case</strong>, with major words capitalized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-mistake-to-avoid">Common mistake to avoid</h3>
<p>Writing <em>Modern Storytelling</em> would be incorrect because it treats the article as a standalone work.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-chapter-in-a-book">
<h2 >Example 2: Chapter in a Book</h2>
<p><strong>Correct MLA title formatting (titles only):</strong><br />

- Book title: <em>Teaching Writing in High School</em></p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>The chapter is a <strong>part of a book</strong>, so it uses <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li>The book is a <strong>complete work</strong>, so it uses <strong>italics</strong>.</li>
<li>The subtitle after the colon follows Title Case too. “to” is a preposition and stays lowercase because it is not the first or last word.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-mistake-to-avoid">Common mistake to avoid</h3>
<p>Do not write "<em>Teaching Writing in High School</em>" in quotation marks. That would incorrectly label the book as a shorter work.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-web-page-on-a-website">
<h2 >Example 3: Web Page on a Website</h2>
<p><strong>Correct MLA title formatting (titles only):</strong><br />

- Website name: <em>National Geographic</em></p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>A specific page, article, or post on a site is a <strong>shorter work</strong>, so it uses <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</li>
<li>The website name is the <strong>container</strong>, so it uses <strong>italics</strong>.</li>
<li>The page title is in <strong>Title Case</strong>. “of” is a preposition and stays lowercase because it is not the first or last word.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>If it is a whole thing, italicize it.</strong> Books, films, journals, websites, TV series.</li>

<li><strong>Always apply Title Case</strong>, even if the source itself displays the title differently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copying a title exactly as styled online.</strong> Many sites use sentence case or all caps. MLA still requires Title Case.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the container.</strong> A web page often needs both the page title in quotation marks and the website name in italics.</li>
<li><strong>Double formatting.</strong> Never combine italics and quotation marks on the same title.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-a-citation-guide">
<h2 >Why These Rules Matter in a Citation Guide</h2>
<p>MLA formatting is designed to be readable and predictable. When readers see italics, they expect a complete work. When they see quotation marks, they expect a smaller part of a larger source. Title Case adds consistency across all source types. Together, these rules reduce confusion, support academic credibility, and make it easier for your audience to locate the exact text you used.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-date-formatting-the-core-idea">
<h2 >MLA 9 date formatting, the core idea</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, dates are part of the “publication facts” of a source. The key is consistency and order. MLA does not treat the date like APA does, so you do not put the year right after the author in parentheses. Instead, the date usually appears later in the citation, after the publisher, and before page numbers or a URL. This placement helps readers follow a predictable sequence and quickly locate the information they need.</p>
<p>MLA date rules matter because small formatting choices affect clarity. A reader should be able to scan a Works Cited entry and immediately see what was published, who published it, when it was published, and where to find it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="date-placement-in-mla-9-after-the-publisher">
<h2 >Date placement in MLA 9, after the publisher</h2>
<h3 id="the-rule">The rule</h3>
<p>For most citations, MLA places the date <strong>after the publisher</strong> and <strong>before</strong> page numbers or the URL. This is the publication sequence described in MLA 9. It prevents confusion and keeps citations consistent across different source types.</p>
<p><strong>Correct order (typical):</strong><br />
Author. Title. Publisher, Date, Page range or URL.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>If the date appears in the wrong place, readers can misread the citation. For example, placing the date after the pages can make it look like the pages are part of a different element. Placing the date after the author, especially in parentheses, makes the citation look like APA style, which MLA is not.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Putting the date right after the author in parentheses, for example, <code>Author. (2024). Title.</code></li>
<li>Placing the date after page numbers or after the URL.</li>
<li>Using parentheses around the year.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="day-month-year-format-for-specific-dates">
<h2 >Day Month Year format for specific dates</h2>
<h3 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Day Month Year</strong> for sources that provide a specific publication date, such as:<br />
- Websites and web pages<br />
- Newspaper articles<br />
- Magazine articles<br />
- Many online journal articles that list a full date</p>
<h3 id="the-format">The format</h3>
<p>MLA uses:<br />
- Day as a number<br />
- Month abbreviated<br />
- Year as a number<br />
- No commas in the date</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <code>5 Feb. 2024</code><br />
<strong>Correct:</strong> <code>28 Dec. 2025</code></p>
<p>Months are abbreviated as follows: Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, June, July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.</p>
<h3 id="what-not-to-do">What not to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not write <code>Feb. 5, 2024</code>, this is month day year with a comma.</li>
<li>Do not write <code>2024-02-05</code>, this is ISO style.</li>
<li>Do not add commas inside the date.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>MLA is used internationally, so Day Month Year reduces ambiguity. It also creates a clean, uniform look in Works Cited entries.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="year-only-format-for-books-and-other-sources">
<h2 >Year only format for books and other sources</h2>
<h3 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it</h3>
<p>Many sources, especially print books and some films, list only a year. In that case, MLA uses <strong>just the year</strong>, followed by a period.</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <code>2024.</code><br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> <code>(2024)</code></p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Parentheses signal a different citation system. MLA keeps the Works Cited entry as a sentence-like string of elements, separated by punctuation, so the year appears as a normal element, not a parenthetical note.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="no-publication-date-available-omit-it">
<h2 >No publication date available, omit it</h2>
<h3 id="the-rule">The rule</h3>
<p>If you cannot find a publication date, MLA says to <strong>omit the date element entirely</strong>. Do not insert a placeholder like <code>n.d.</code></p>
<p><strong>Correct pattern:</strong><br />
Author. Title. Publisher, URL.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect pattern:</strong><br />
Publisher, n.d., URL.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Placeholders can be misleading. “No date” does not help a reader locate the source, and MLA prefers accuracy over guesswork. If the date is missing, you simply leave it out and move to the next element.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Before omitting the date, check common places where it may be hidden:<br />
- The top or bottom of the web page<br />
- An “About” or “Article history” section<br />
- The PDF header or first page for journal articles<br />
- Database record details</p>

<section class="content-section" id="access-dates-optional-but-often-useful">
<h2 >Access dates, optional but often useful</h2>
<h3 id="when-to-include-an-access-date">When to include an access date</h3>
<p>MLA allows access dates and recommends them when content is likely to change, such as:<br />
- Wikis<br />
- Continuously updated news pages<br />
- Dynamic databases<br />
- Pages that do not clearly show a publication date</p>
<h3 id="how-to-format-it">How to format it</h3>
<p>Access dates go at the <strong>very end</strong> of the citation and use the same Day Month Year format.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Accessed 28 Dec. 2025.</code></p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing the access date without the word “Accessed.”</li>
<li>Using the wrong date format, such as <code>Dec. 28, 2025</code>.</li>
<li>Putting the access date before the URL.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="urls-in-mla-9-remove-http-and-https">
<h2 >URLs in MLA 9, remove http:// and https://</h2>
<h3 id="the-rule">The rule</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, you typically present URLs without the protocol, meaning you remove <code>http://</code> and <code>https://</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <code>www.example.com/article</code><br />
<strong>Correct:</strong> <code>doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx</code><br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> <code>https://www.example.com/article</code></p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Removing the protocol keeps entries cleaner and more readable. The link is still identifiable and usable, and most readers understand that a web address can be visited without seeing the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If your instructor or institution requires full URLs, follow that local requirement, but MLA’s default guidance is to omit the protocol.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="doi-formatting-in-mla-9">
<h2 >DOI formatting in MLA 9</h2>
<h3 id="what-a-doi-is">What a DOI is</h3>
<p>A DOI is a stable identifier for a digital publication, often used for journal articles. It is usually more reliable than a regular URL because it is designed to remain consistent even if the web location changes.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-format-a-doi-in-mla-9">How to format a DOI in MLA 9</h3>
<p>MLA prefers DOIs in a URL-like form. Present the DOI as a link beginning with <code>doi.org/</code> and, like other URLs, omit <code>https://</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <code>doi.org/10.1234/abcd.5678</code></p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing <code>DOI: 10.1234/abcd.5678</code> instead of using the doi.org form.</li>
<li>Keeping <code>https://doi.org/...</code> when MLA style calls for removing the protocol.</li>
<li>Treating the DOI like a database label rather than a locator.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-correct-formatting-and-explanations">
<h2 >Examples with correct formatting and explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-journal-article-with-doi-and-page-range">Example 1, journal article with DOI and page range</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct MLA 9 formatting):</strong><br />
Lopez, Marisol. “Urban Heat and Public Health.” <em>Journal of Environmental Studies</em>, vol. 18, no. 2, 5 Feb. 2024, pp. 45-58, doi.org/10.1234/jes.2024.0182.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct</strong><br />
- The specific publication date uses Day Month Year, <code>5 Feb. 2024</code>, with no commas.<br />
- The date appears after the journal issue information and before the page range and DOI locator, following the MLA publication sequence.<br />
- The DOI is formatted as <code>doi.org/...</code> and does not include <code>https://</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid</strong><br />
Do not write <code>Feb. 5, 2024</code>, and do not place the date after the pages.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is correct</strong><br />
- The publication date uses Day Month Year, <code>28 Dec. 2025</code>.<br />
- The URL does not include <code>https://</code>.<br />
- The access date appears at the end and begins with “Accessed,” then uses the same Day Month Year format.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid</strong><br />
Do not place the access date before the URL, and do not write <code>Accessed Dec. 31, 2025</code>.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-book-with-year-only-and-correct-date-placement">Example 3, book with year only and correct date placement</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct MLA 9 formatting):</strong><br />
Patel, Rina. <em>Water Systems and Society</em>. Greenleaf Press, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is correct</strong><br />
- A book commonly provides only a year, so <code>2024.</code> is sufficient.<br />
- The year appears after the publisher, not after the author.<br />
- There are no parentheses around the year.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid</strong><br />
Do not write <code>Patel, Rina. (2024). Water Systems and Society.</code> That is not MLA style.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Day Month Year only when you have a specific day listed in the source.</li>
<li>Abbreviate months consistently, and remember that May, June, and July are not abbreviated.</li>
<li>Remove <code>http://</code> and <code>https://</code> from URLs and DOI links.</li>

</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-mla-9-in-text-citations-do">
<h2 >What MLA 9 in-text citations do</h2>
<p>MLA 9 in-text citations tell readers two things quickly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who</strong> the information came from, usually the author’s last name.</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> to find it in the source, usually a page number.</li>
</ol>
<p>They work together with your <strong>Works Cited</strong> list. The in-text citation points to the full entry, and the Works Cited entry gives complete publication details. This system matters because it lets readers verify your evidence, follow your research trail, and see which ideas are yours versus borrowed.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="two-main-styles-parenthetical-and-narrative-citations">
<h2 >Two main styles, parenthetical and narrative citations</h2>
<p>MLA 9 gives you two common ways to cite sources in your sentences. Both are correct when formatted properly.</p>
<h3 id="parenthetical-citations">Parenthetical citations</h3>
<p>A <strong>parenthetical citation</strong> places the author and page number in parentheses, usually at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Basic format</strong><br />
- <strong>(Author Page)</strong></p>
<p>Key punctuation rule: <strong>Do not use a comma between author and page number</strong>, and <strong>do not use p. or pp.</strong> in the parentheses.</p>
<p>Correct: <strong>(Morrison 42)</strong><br />
Incorrect: <strong>(Morrison, 42)</strong><br />
Incorrect: <strong>(Morrison, p. 42)</strong></p>
<h3 id="narrative-citations">Narrative citations</h3>
<p>A <strong>narrative citation</strong> names the author in the sentence itself. Then you put only the page number in parentheses.</p>
<p><strong>Basic format</strong><br />
- Author in the sentence, then <strong>(Page)</strong></p>
<p>Example: Morrison describes the community’s memory as both protective and painful <strong>(42)</strong>.</p>
<p>Narrative citations matter because they can make your writing flow more smoothly. They also reduce repetition when you discuss the same source across several sentences.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-author-page-format-and-why-mla-does-not-use-p-or-pp-in-text">
<h2 >The author-page format, and why MLA does not use p. or pp. in-text</h2>
<h3 id="what-author-page-means">What “author-page” means</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, most in-text citations follow the <strong>author-page</strong> pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Author’s last name, then a space, then the page number.</li>
<li>No comma.</li>
<li>No extra labels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct: <strong>(Ng 116)</strong><br />
Correct: <strong>Ng 116</strong> is not correct unless it is part of your sentence in a narrative structure. Most of the time you will use parentheses.</p>
<h3 id="why-you-do-not-write-p-or-pp-in-the-in-text-citation">Why you do not write p. or pp. in the in-text citation</h3>
<p>MLA’s in-text system is designed to be minimal. The reader already knows the number refers to a page because the Works Cited entry shows the source type. This is why MLA 9 requires <strong>only the author and page number</strong> in parentheses.</p>
<p>This rule also prevents clutter. Compare these two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean MLA style: <strong>(Morrison 42)</strong></li>
<li>Cluttered and incorrect: <strong>(Morrison, p. 42)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-p-and-pp-do-belong">Where p. and pp. do belong</h3>
<p>Use <strong>p.</strong> or <strong>pp.</strong> in <strong>Works Cited</strong> entries for page numbers or page ranges, not in the in-text citation. For example, a journal article in Works Cited might include <strong>pp. 45-58</strong>, but the in-text citation would still be <strong>(Author 47)</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="where-the-in-text-citation-goes-in-the-sentence">
<h2 >Where the in-text citation goes in the sentence</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, the in-text citation usually appears at the end of the sentence, before the final period.</p>
<p>Example: The character’s recollection is shaped by communal storytelling <strong>(Morrison 42)</strong>.</p>
<p>If you include a quotation, the citation still comes at the end of the borrowed material, before the period.</p>
<p>Example: The narrator calls the memory “a kind of careful haunting” <strong>(Morrison 42)</strong>.</p>
<p>This placement matters because it clearly shows which sentence contains borrowed information. It also avoids confusion about whether the citation applies to one sentence or the next.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="handling-sources-without-page-numbers">
<h2 >Handling sources without page numbers</h2>
<p>Some sources do not have stable page numbers. Common examples include many web pages, some ebooks, videos, podcasts, and social media posts. MLA 9 still expects you to help readers locate the information, but you should not invent page numbers.</p>
<h3 id="if-there-are-no-page-numbers-omit-the-page-number">If there are no page numbers, omit the page number</h3>
<p>If a source has no page numbers, you usually cite <strong>only the author</strong>.</p>
<p>Example: Community memory is described as both shared and contested <strong>(Morrison)</strong>.</p>
<p>This works best when your Works Cited entry clearly identifies the source.</p>
<h3 id="if-there-is-no-author-use-a-shortened-title">If there is no author, use a shortened title</h3>
<p>When a source has no author, MLA uses a <strong>shortened title</strong> in the in-text citation. Use the first key word or two from the Works Cited entry. Put it in quotation marks if it is a web page or article title. Italicize it if it is a book, film, or website title.</p>
<p>Example with a web page title: The policy was updated recently to clarify eligibility requirements <strong>("Financial Aid Updates")</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="use-other-location-markers-when-they-are-stable-and-helpful">Use other location markers when they are stable and helpful</h3>
<p>If a source provides another stable locator, you can use it. The goal is to help readers find the passage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paragraph numbers</strong>, if the paragraphs are clearly numbered.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter numbers</strong>, for ebooks or long online texts.</li>
<li><strong>Time stamps</strong>, for videos and audio sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use paragraph numbers, you can write something like <strong>(Author par. 4)</strong>. If you use time stamps, you can write something like <strong>(Author 00:12:35-00:13:10)</strong>. Use these only when they truly help the reader locate the information.</p>

</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-parenthetical-citation-with-a-print-book-page-number">
<h2 >Example 1, parenthetical citation with a print book page number</h2>
<p>Sentence: Sethe’s memories repeatedly return in fragments that disrupt the present <strong>(Morrison 42)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- It follows MLA’s author-page format, <strong>(Morrison 42)</strong>.<br />
- There is <strong>no comma</strong> between Morrison and 42.<br />
- There is <strong>no p. or pp.</strong> in the in-text citation.<br />
- The citation appears <strong>before the period</strong>, which makes the boundary of borrowed material clear.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you mention the author in the sentence, switch to narrative style to avoid repetition.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-narrative-citation-with-a-quotation">
<h2 >Example 2, narrative citation with a quotation</h2>
<p>Sentence: Morrison describes the past as something that “was not a story to pass on” <strong>(274)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author’s name appears in the sentence, so the parentheses contain <strong>only the page number</strong>.<br />
- The page number still helps the reader locate the quotation in the print text.<br />
- The citation sits after the quotation marks but before the period, which is MLA’s standard placement.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Do not write <strong>(p. 274)</strong> or <strong>(pg. 274)</strong>. MLA does not use those labels in-text.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-web-source-with-no-page-numbers">
<h2 >Example 3, web source with no page numbers</h2>
<p>Sentence: The organization emphasizes that application requirements can change during the academic year <strong>("Financial Aid Updates")</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The source has no page numbers, so none are included.<br />
- There is no author listed, so the citation uses a <strong>shortened title</strong> that matches the Works Cited entry.<br />
- Quotation marks signal that the shortened title refers to a web page or article title.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
Make sure the first words in your in-text citation match the beginning of the Works Cited entry. Consistency is what lets readers connect the two.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-credibility-clarity-and-consistency">
<h2 >Why these rules matter, credibility, clarity, and consistency</h2>
<p>MLA’s in-text rules are strict for a reason.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Accurate citations show you are not presenting someone else’s words or ideas as your own.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> The author-page format gives readers a quick locator without interrupting your writing.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> MLA expects the same system throughout the paper, which helps readers scan and understand your sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even small punctuation choices matter. In MLA, a comma in <strong>(Morrison, 42)</strong> is not a style preference. It is an error because MLA specifies <strong>no comma</strong> in author-page citations. Similarly, adding <strong>p.</strong> or <strong>pp.</strong> in-text conflicts with MLA’s rule that in-text citations remain minimal.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-and-common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mention the author in your sentence when it improves flow, then cite only the page number in parentheses.</li>
<li>Keep citations close to the borrowed material, especially when you summarize or paraphrase.</li>
<li>If you cite the same source repeatedly in a paragraph, you can often use narrative references to reduce repetition, but keep it clear which source you mean.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adding <strong>p.</strong> or <strong>pp.</strong> in the in-text citation.</li>
<li>Inserting a comma, as in <strong>(Morrison, 42)</strong>.</li>
<li>Using a URL in the in-text citation instead of an author or title.</li>
<li>Creating page numbers for web pages that do not have them.</li>
<li>Using a title in the in-text citation that does not match the Works Cited entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, I can also provide a quick checklist for deciding what to cite when a source has no author, no page numbers, or both, and I can model the matching Works Cited entries so the in-text examples connect cleanly to full citations.</p>

<h2 >✅ Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Use this checklist to verify your citations before submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
