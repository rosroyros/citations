<section class="content-section" id="what-npr-means-in-mla-9-citations">
<h2 >What “NPR” means in MLA 9 citations</h2>
<p>NPR content shows up in a few common forms, and MLA 9 treats each form based on what you actually used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NPR news articles on NPR.org</strong> (a web page with text)</li>
<li><strong>NPR audio stories and podcast episodes</strong> (a web page that hosts an audio segment, often with a transcript)</li>
<li><strong>NPR programs as containers</strong> (for example, <em>Morning Edition</em> or <em>All Things Considered</em>, which can function like a “series” or “show”)</li>
</ul>
<p>In MLA 9, you cite the version you consulted, usually the <strong>NPR web page</strong> for the story or episode. That page is the most stable “container” because it includes the title, date, URL, and often the contributors.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-core-idea-build-citations-from-elements">
<h2 >MLA 9 core idea, build citations from “elements”</h2>
<p>MLA 9 uses a flexible template. You include the elements that apply, in this general order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Author</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of source</strong> (article title or episode title, in quotation marks)</li>
<li><strong>Title of container</strong> (the website, show, or podcast, in italics)</li>
<li><strong>Other contributors</strong> (like “Hosted by …” if relevant)</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong> (not common for NPR pages)</li>
<li><strong>Number</strong> (episode number, if provided)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> (often NPR)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> (URL)</li>
</ol>
<p>Not every NPR page will have every element. The goal is to provide enough information for a reader to find the exact item you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-for-npr-apply-your-required-name-format">
<h2 >Author rules for NPR, apply your required name format</h2>
<p>Because you specified strict author rules, apply them consistently to NPR items:</p>
<h3 id="one-author">One author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the author’s <strong>full first name</strong>, not initials.</li>
<li>Invert the first author’s name: <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- Lastname, Firstname. “Title.” <em>Container</em>, Publisher, Date, URL.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted.</li>
<li>Second author is normal order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- Lastname, Firstname, and Firstname Lastname. “Title.” <em>Container</em>, Publisher, Date, URL.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>List only the first author (inverted, full first name).</li>
<li>Add <strong>et al.</strong> immediately after.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- Lastname, Firstname, et al. “Title.” <em>Container</em>, Publisher, Date, URL.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-listed">No author listed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <strong>title of the source</strong> in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</li>
<li>Alphabetize by the title, ignoring A, An, The.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- “Title.” <em>Container</em>, Publisher, Date, URL.</p>
<p>Why these rules matter: MLA Works Cited entries are alphabetized, so inverting the first author supports consistent sorting. Using full first names improves clarity, especially when NPR has contributors with similar last names.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="choosing-the-right-container-for-npr">
<h2 >Choosing the right “container” for NPR</h2>
<p>NPR items often have more than one plausible container. The simplest and most common approach is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>NPR.org</strong> as the container when you used the NPR web page.</li>
<li>If the page clearly belongs to a specific show or podcast, you can also include that show as a container element if it helps identification, but do not overcomplicate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>A practical approach that stays clean:<br />
- <strong>Title of source</strong> in quotes<br />
- <strong>NPR</strong> (or <em>NPR</em>) as the container<br />
- <strong>NPR</strong> as publisher if listed<br />
- Date and URL</p>
<p>Many instructors accept <em>NPR</em> as the container title. If the page is explicitly under a show brand, you can use that show as the container instead, but be consistent across your paper.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-urls-and-access-dates-for-npr">
<h2 >Dates, URLs, and access dates for NPR</h2>
<h3 id="publication-date">Publication date</h3>
<p>Use the date shown on the NPR page, usually formatted like:<br />
- 12 Jan. 2024</p>
<p>MLA uses abbreviated months (Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., etc.).</p>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>Include the direct URL to the NPR page. MLA 9 allows you to drop “https://” if you want, but keeping it is fine if you are consistent.</p>
<h3 id="access-date">Access date</h3>
<p>MLA 9 says access dates are optional, but they are useful when:<br />
- The page has no clear publication date<br />
- The content is likely to change<br />
- Your instructor requires it</p>
<p>If you include an access date, put it at the end:<br />
- Accessed 20 May 2025.</p>

<h2 >Examples, with explanations and correct formatting</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-npr-news-article-with-one-author-most-common">
<h2 >Example 1, NPR news article with one author (most common)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Inskeep, Steve. “Title of the NPR Article.” <em>NPR</em>, NPR, 15 Oct. 2023, https://www.npr.org/xxxxx.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Author</strong>: Steve Inskeep is listed first, inverted as <strong>Inskeep, Steve</strong>, and uses a full first name.<br />
- <strong>Title of source</strong>: The article title is in quotation marks because it is a short work within a larger site.<br />
- <strong>Container</strong>: <em>NPR</em> is italicized as the website container.<br />
- <strong>Publisher</strong>: NPR often functions as the publisher as well, so you may see <em>NPR</em>, NPR. This repetition is acceptable in MLA when the site name and publisher match, and your guide can keep it for clarity.<br />
- <strong>Date</strong>: Uses MLA month abbreviation.<br />
- <strong>Location</strong>: The URL points directly to the item.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation</strong><br />
- (Inskeep)</p>
<p>Tip: If there are two Steve Inskeeps, or two authors with the same last name in your Works Cited, MLA allows adding a first name in the in-text citation, but that is rare.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-npr-story-or-episode-with-two-authors">
<h2 >Example 2, NPR story or episode with two authors</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Garcia-Navarro, Lulu, and Daniel Wood. “Title of the Story or Episode.” <em>NPR</em>, NPR, 8 Mar. 2022, https://www.npr.org/xxxxx.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Two-author rule</strong>: First author is inverted, second is not. You use <strong>and</strong> between them.<br />
- <strong>Full first names</strong>: Lulu and Daniel are written out, not as initials.<br />
- <strong>Title in quotes</strong>: It is still a short work hosted on a site.<br />
- <strong>Container and publisher</strong>: <em>NPR</em>, NPR is a common and acceptable pairing when NPR is both site and publisher.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation</strong><br />
- (Garcia-Navarro and Wood)</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Do not invert the second author’s name. MLA only inverts the first author in the Works Cited entry.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">
<h2 >Example 3, three or more authors, use et al.</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Smith, Emily, et al. “Title of the NPR Piece.” <em>NPR</em>, NPR, 21 June 2021, https://www.npr.org/xxxxx.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Three or more authors</strong>: Only the first author is listed, then <strong>et al.</strong> This keeps citations readable.<br />
- <strong>First author inverted</strong>: Smith, Emily.<br />
- <strong>Full first name</strong>: Emily is not abbreviated.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation</strong><br />
- (Smith et al.)</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Do not list the first two or first three authors before et al. Under your rules, list only the first author, then et al.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="using-initials-instead-of-full-first-names">
<h2 >Using initials instead of full first names</h2>
<p>Your rules require full first names. If the page shows an initial, check the author’s NPR profile page for the full first name when possible.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="treating-the-show-host-as-the-author">
<h2 >Treating the show host as the author</h2>
<p>NPR pages sometimes list hosts, producers, editors, and reporters. In MLA, the <strong>author</strong> is usually the person credited as the writer or reporter for the piece. If the page clearly labels “By First Last,” that is your author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="forgetting-quotation-marks-around-the-story-title">
<h2 >Forgetting quotation marks around the story title</h2>
<p>NPR stories and episodes are typically short works within a larger container, so the title should be in quotation marks, not italics.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="using-nd-when-no-date-appears">
<h2 >Using “n.d.” when no date appears</h2>
<p>MLA does not use “n.d.” in the way some other styles do. If there is no date, omit it, and consider adding an access date.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter, readability, credibility, and retrievability</h2>
<p>Consistent MLA formatting is not just about looking correct. It helps your reader do three important things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the creator</strong> quickly, which is why inverted first author names and full first names matter.</li>
<li><strong>Understand what you used</strong>, which is why titles and containers are formatted differently.</li>
<li><strong>Find the source again</strong>, which is why the date and direct URL are important for NPR pages that can be updated or republished.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you tell me which NPR format you are using most, article pages, podcast episodes, or radio segments, I can tailor a mini template set and in-text citation examples to match your exact assignment.</p>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Npr citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-npr-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes NPR citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>NPR content often sits at the intersection of several MLA source types. An NPR page might look like a single web article, but it can also be a transcript of an audio segment, a page that hosts an embedded podcast episode, or a broadcast segment that later appears online with updates. These “hybrid” formats create edge cases about what to treat as the container, who counts as the author, and which date to use.</p>
<p>Your author rules also matter a lot for NPR because NPR pages frequently list multiple contributors with different roles, such as reporter, host, editor, producer, and photographer. MLA asks you to name the author most responsible for the work you are citing, then include other contributors only when they are important to identifying the source. If you treat every listed staff member as an author, your citations become cluttered and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Below are the most common special cases and how to handle them in MLA 9 while following your author rules.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-npr-pages-with-multiple-contributor-roles">
<h2 >Special case 1, NPR pages with multiple contributor roles</h2>
<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>
<p>NPR pages often show lines like “By Jane Doe, John Smith” and also list “Edited by,” “Produced by,” or “Photos by.” These roles are not always “authors” in MLA terms.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-decide">How to decide</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the page clearly says “By [name],” treat that person as the author.</li>
<li>If there are two “By” names, use both as authors.</li>
<li>If there are three or more “By” names, use the first author plus “et al.”</li>
<li>If the page lists a host or producer but no “By” line, you may have no author for the web text, or you may be citing an audio segment where the host is the main credited creator. Your choice should match what you are actually using, the written article or the audio segment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you are quoting the written text on the page, prioritize the “By” line as the author. If you are quoting the audio itself, consider citing the audio program or episode, where the host or reporter may be the primary creator.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Listing “Edited by” or “Produced by” people as authors when the page already has a “By” line. In MLA, those roles can be included as “Other contributors” only if they help identify the work, but they usually are not necessary.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-no-author-shown-or-ambiguous-authorship">
<h2 >Special case 2, no author shown or ambiguous authorship</h2>
<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>
<p>Some NPR pages, especially program pages, live blogs, corrections, or informational pages, have no personal author. Sometimes the only “author” appears to be “NPR.”</p>
<h3 id="mla-approach-under-your-rules">MLA approach under your rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>If there is no author, start with the title of the specific page or segment.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous.”</li>
<li>Do not insert “n.d.”</li>
<li>Alphabetize by title, ignoring A, An, The.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Look for a personal name near the title, near the top of the story, or at the bottom. If none appears, treat it as no author and begin with the title.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Using “NPR” as the author by default. In MLA, a corporate author can be used when the organization is truly the author, but many NPR pages function more like web pages within the NPR site. If a personal author is not credited, beginning with the title is usually cleaner and matches your “NO AUTHOR” rule.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-transcript-pages-versus-audio-segments">
<h2 >Special case 3, transcript pages versus audio segments</h2>
<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>
<p>NPR often posts a transcript of a broadcast segment. The transcript might be edited for clarity, might omit parts, and might include bracketed notes. If you cite the transcript as text, you are citing a web page. If you cite the broadcast audio, you are citing an audio work.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-choose-correctly">How to choose correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you quote words from the transcript text, cite the web page that contains the transcript.</li>
<li>If you quote something you heard in the audio, cite the audio segment or podcast episode, even if a transcript exists.</li>
<li>If you use both, you can cite both sources separately, or cite the audio and mention that you consulted the transcript in your notes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>When possible, include a time stamp in your in-text citation for audio. MLA allows time ranges for audiovisual works. NPR pages sometimes provide time markers in the audio player.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Citing the transcript page but quoting the audio, especially if the transcript differs slightly. That mismatch can cause credibility problems.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-npr-content-republished-or-syndicated">
<h2 >Special case 4, NPR content republished or syndicated</h2>
<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>
<p>NPR stories can appear on member station sites, partner sites, Apple News, or other aggregators. You might also find the same text with a different URL.</p>
<h3 id="mla-best-practice">MLA best practice</h3>
<p>Cite the version you actually used. If you read it on a station site, cite that site as the container. If you read it on NPR.org, cite NPR as the container.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the republished page credits NPR and links back, prefer the original NPR page when available. It is usually more stable and includes fuller metadata.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Mixing details from two versions, such as using the NPR title but a station URL, or using a station date with an NPR page.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-dates-updates-and-time-sensitive-pages">
<h2 >Special case 5, dates, updates, and time sensitive pages</h2>
<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>
<p>NPR pages often show both an original publish date and an updated date. Some pages also show a time.</p>
<h3 id="mla-approach">MLA approach</h3>
<p>Use the date that best represents the version you consulted. If the page clearly indicates “Updated,” you can use that updated date because it reflects the current content. If you are discussing a story as it originally broke, you can use the original date if it is shown and relevant.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the page changes frequently, consider adding an access date. MLA 9 does not require access dates for stable sources, but it is helpful for content that may change.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Using the date you accessed the page as the main date. Access date is optional and separate, it is not a substitute for publication date.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue">The issue</h3>
<p>NPR content may belong to a program such as All Things Considered, Morning Edition, or Planet Money. It may also be part of a series page. MLA containers can stack, but you should avoid overcomplicating the citation.</p>
<h3 id="mla-approach">MLA approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are citing a specific story page on NPR.org, NPR is usually the main container (the website).</li>
<li>If you are citing a podcast episode, the podcast title is the container, and the platform can be a second container if you listened somewhere else.</li>
<li>If the program name is central to identifying the segment, you can include it as the container or as an additional element, depending on the format.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Ask, “What is the work?” If it is a web article, treat it as an article on a website. If it is an episode, treat it as an episode of a podcast.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Treating the program name as the website. “All Things Considered” is a program, NPR is the site. They are not interchangeable.</p>

<h2 >Examples with correct formatting and why they work</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-two-authors-on-an-npr-web-article">
<h2 >Example 1, two authors on an NPR web article</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Doe, Jane Marie, and John Alexander Smith. “Title of the NPR Article.” <em>NPR</em>, 15 Mar. 2024, https://www.npr.org/xxxx/xx/xx/xxxxxxxx/title-of-the-npr-article.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, “Doe, Jane Marie,” which supports alphabetical ordering.<br />
- The second author is in normal order, “John Alexander Smith,” and joined with “and,” which matches MLA rules for two authors and your requirements.<br />
- The article title is in quotation marks because it is a short work within a larger container.<br />
- <em>NPR</em> is italicized as the website container.<br />
- The date is included in day month year format.<br />
- The URL is included without extra punctuation at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
Copying names from NPR often yields shortened forms or middle initials. Under your rules, use full first names, and include middle names when available. If the page only provides a middle initial and you cannot verify the full middle name, keep what you can confirm, but do not invent a full name.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-three-or-more-authors-applying-et-al">
<h2 >Example 2, three or more authors, applying “et al.”</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Garcia, Maria Elena, et al. “Title of the NPR Story with Many Contributors.” <em>NPR</em>, 2 July 2023, https://www.npr.org/xxxx/xx/xx/xxxxxxxx/title-of-story.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- Only the first author is listed, inverted, with a full first name.<br />
- “et al.” replaces the remaining authors, which prevents an overly long author element and follows your rule for three or more authors.<br />
- The rest of the citation remains the same as a standard NPR web article.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Writing “Garcia, Maria Elena, John Smith, and Priya Patel.” That is not MLA style for three or more authors in Works Cited entries. Use “et al.” after the first author only.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-transcript-page-on-npr">
<h2 >Example 3, no author, transcript page on NPR</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
“Title of the Segment Transcript.” <em>NPR</em>, 10 Jan. 2025, https://www.npr.org/xxxx/xx/xx/xxxxxxxx/title-of-segment-transcript.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- There is no author, so the citation starts with the title.<br />
- The title is in quotation marks because it is a page or segment, not a whole site.<br />
- <em>NPR</em> is the container.<br />
- The date and URL identify the exact version you consulted.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you are citing the audio instead of the transcript, your citation structure may change. You would cite the episode or segment as an audio work, and you may include the program title and the platform you used. Match the citation to the format you actually used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-for-npr-citations">
<h2 >Why these rules matter for NPR citations</h2>
<p>Consistency is not just cosmetic in MLA. It affects how easily a reader can:<br />
- Find your source quickly in a Works Cited list.<br />
- Understand who is responsible for the information.<br />
- Distinguish between the work itself (the story or segment) and the container (NPR as the site, or a podcast platform).<br />
- Track versions when a story is updated.</p>
<p>Your author rules, especially full first names and correct inversion, reduce ambiguity. NPR sometimes has contributors with similar last names or common first names. Full names make it clearer which person wrote the piece. The “et al.” rule keeps citations readable while still giving credit.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-checklist-practical-tips-and-common-pitfalls">
<h2 >Quick checklist, practical tips and common pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirm what you used</strong>, web text, transcript text, or audio.</li>
<li><strong>Use the “By” line for authors</strong> when present, and do not promote editors or producers to authors unless the page lacks a writer and clearly credits a creator role you are citing.</li>
<li><strong>Apply your author formatting strictly</strong>, first author inverted, two authors joined by “and,” three or more authors use “et al.”</li>
<li><strong>If no author, start with the title</strong>, do not use “Anonymous.”</li>
<li><strong>Use the most relevant date</strong>, and add an access date only when the page is likely to change.</li>
<li><strong>Do not mix containers</strong>, NPR is the website container, a program title is not the same thing as the site.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="frequently-asked-questions">
<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-npr-article-in-mla-9">How do I cite an NPR article in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite an NPR news article on the NPR website in MLA 9, list the author (if shown), the article title in quotation marks, the website name in italics (NPR), the publisher (usually omitted when it matches the site name), the publication date, the URL, and an access date only if your instructor wants it or the content is likely to change. Example structure: Lastname, Firstname. "Title of Article." NPR, Day Month Year, URL. If there is no author, start with the title. If there is a section label like Politics or Health, you generally do not include it unless it is presented as part of the container. For more guidance on MLA core elements, see the MLA Works Cited format overview: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-npr-radio-segment-or-podcast-episode-in-mla-9">How do I cite an NPR radio segment or podcast episode in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>For an NPR audio segment or podcast episode, you usually cite it as an audio work on a website. Start with the episode or segment title in quotation marks. Then list the program or podcast title in italics, the publisher (NPR), the date, and the URL. If a host, reporter, or narrator is important to your discussion, you can include them as an optional contributor, for example, "By" or "Hosted by" in the entry, depending on what NPR displays. Practical scenario, you quote a line from Morning Edition. Your Works Cited entry should point readers to the specific segment page, not just the show homepage. MLA guidance on citing audiovisual and digital works can help you choose roles and containers: https://style.mla.org/citing-audio-visual-materials/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-npr-page-has-no-author-or-it-lists-multiple-contributors">What if the NPR page has no author, or it lists multiple contributors?</h3>
<p>If an NPR page does not list an author, begin the Works Cited entry with the title of the page or segment. Do not invent an author, and do not use "Anonymous." If multiple contributors are listed, MLA 9 lets you name the author most responsible for the content, often the reporter credited near the headline. If you cite two authors, list them in the order shown. If there are three or more, list the first author followed by et al. Practical scenario, an NPR story credits a reporter and a photographer. If you are analyzing the written reporting, cite the reporter as author and ignore the photographer unless the images are central to your source use. For author rules and et al., see: https://style.mla.org/author-names/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-npr-sources-in-mla-9">How do I do in-text citations for NPR sources in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, in-text citations usually use the author last name and a page number. NPR web pages and audio pages typically have no page numbers, so you usually cite only the author last name in parentheses, for example (Smith). If there is no author, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, for example ("Wildfire Smoke"). Practical scenario, you quote a sentence from an NPR article with no author, then your parenthetical should match the first words of the Works Cited entry so readers can find it quickly. For audio, you can also include a time range in your prose, for example, At 02:15, the host states, and then use the standard author or title in parentheses. More on MLA in-text citations: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-include-the-date-i-accessed-npr-and-should-i-use-the-long-url">Do I need to include the date I accessed NPR, and should I use the long URL?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but they are useful when a page is likely to change, when there is no publication date, or when your instructor requires them. Many NPR pages have stable URLs and clear dates, so an access date is often not necessary. If you do include it, place it at the end, for example, Accessed 1 Jan. 2026. Use the direct URL to the specific story or segment page, and do not link only to the NPR homepage. MLA recommends including URLs without https:// as long as the link works, but many instructors accept either format. Practical scenario, you used an NPR live update page that changes during the day, adding an access date helps document what you saw. MLA URL guidance: https://style.mla.org/urls-doi/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-npr-content-i-found-on-youtube-apple-podcasts-or-spotify-instead-of-the-npr-site">How do I cite NPR content I found on YouTube, Apple Podcasts, or Spotify instead of the NPR site?</h3>
<p>Cite the version you actually used, because the container changes. If you watched an NPR clip on YouTube, treat YouTube as the container. Start with the video title in quotation marks, then the channel name (often NPR) as the uploader, then YouTube in italics, the upload date, and the URL. If you listened on Spotify or Apple Podcasts, cite the episode title, the podcast title in italics, the platform as the container, the date, and a URL or app link if available. Practical scenario, your class discussion references the YouTube timestamp, so citing the YouTube page is more helpful than citing the NPR transcript page. For MLA rules on citing a work within a container like YouTube, see: https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
