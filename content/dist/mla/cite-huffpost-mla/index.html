<section class="content-section" id="what-a-huffpost-citation-is-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What a HuffPost citation is in MLA 9</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a HuffPost article is usually cited as a <strong>webpage on a news website</strong>. You build the Works Cited entry using MLA’s “core elements” in this order, as they apply:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Author.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of source.</strong> (the article title)</li>
<li><strong>Title of container,</strong> (the website name, HuffPost)</li>
<li><strong>Other contributors,</strong> (often not needed for HuffPost articles)</li>
<li><strong>Version,</strong> (usually not needed)</li>
<li><strong>Number,</strong> (usually not needed)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher,</strong> (often omitted for websites when it is the same as the container, see tips below)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Location.</strong> (URL)</li>
</ol>
<p>For most HuffPost pieces, your citation will look like this general pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Author Last, First Middle. “Article Title.” <em>HuffPost</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>This format helps readers quickly identify who wrote it, what it is called, where it appeared, when it was published, and how to find it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-for-huffpost-in-your-guide-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules for HuffPost in your guide (and why they matter)</h2>
<p>Your guide has specific author rules that go beyond the minimum MLA requirement. These rules matter because they improve clarity, consistency, and fairness in how writers are identified.</p>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Author names must use full first names, not initials.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Initials can hide identity, create confusion between people with similar names, and make it harder for readers to locate the correct author. Using full first names supports accuracy and respects the author’s identity.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If HuffPost shows a name like “J. Smith,” look for the author’s full name on the author profile page. If you cannot verify the full first name, use the name exactly as it appears on the article page rather than inventing a first name.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-inverted">First author inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> The first author must be inverted, Last, First Middle.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element. Inverting the first author’s name makes sorting consistent and predictable.</p>
<p><strong>Correct pattern:</strong><br />
- Smith, Jordan Taylor.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For two authors, use “and” between names. Only the first author is inverted.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA uses “and” to clearly show joint authorship. Keeping the second author in normal order improves readability while preserving alphabetical order by the first author.</p>
<p><strong>Correct pattern:</strong><br />
- Smith, Jordan Taylor, and Casey Morgan.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Three or more authors use “et al.”</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For three or more authors, list only the first author, then add “et al.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Many web articles, especially reported pieces, can have long contributor lists. “Et al.” keeps the citation clean while still crediting the primary listed author.</p>
<p><strong>Correct pattern:</strong><br />
- Smith, Jordan Taylor, et al.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> If there is no author, start with the article title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA prefers using information that actually appears in the source. Starting with the title keeps citations honest and makes them easier to match to the original page.</p>
<p><strong>Alphabetizing note:</strong> Ignore leading articles like “A,” “An,” and “The” when alphabetizing, even though you still print them in the citation.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-formatting-for-huffpost-citations-works-cited">
<h2 >Core formatting for HuffPost citations (Works Cited)</h2>
<h3 id="title-of-the-article">Title of the article</h3>
<p>Put the article title in <strong>quotation marks</strong> because it is a short work within a larger website.</p>
<p>Example format:<br />
- “How to Sleep Better in Winter”</p>
<p>Capitalize using MLA title case, which means capitalize the first word, the last word, and major words in between.</p>
<h3 id="website-name-container">Website name (container)</h3>
<p>Italicize the website name:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>HuffPost</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This signals the larger container that holds the article.</p>
<h3 id="publication-date">Publication date</h3>
<p>MLA typically uses <strong>Day Month Year</strong> when available:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 Mar. 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>If HuffPost provides only month and year, use what you have. If it provides only a year, use the year. Do not add missing information that is not shown.</p>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>Include the URL at the end. MLA 9 allows you to omit “https://” if you want, but many instructors accept either way. Choose one style and use it consistently.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
- https://www.huffpost.com/entry/example</p>
<h3 id="access-date-usually-optional">Access date (usually optional)</h3>
<p>MLA treats access dates as optional, but they can be useful if the page is likely to change or if there is no clear publication date. If your instructor or institution requires access dates, add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rivera, Maria Elena.</strong> The first author is inverted for alphabetizing, and the full first name is used for clarity.</li>
<li><strong>“How to Build a Morning Routine That Actually Sticks.”</strong> The article title is in quotation marks because it is a webpage article.</li>
<li>** <em>HuffPost</em>,** The container is italicized to show the website that published the piece.</li>

<ul>
<li>There is <strong>no author</strong>, so the entry begins with the <strong>title</strong> in quotation marks.</li>

<li>The rest follows the standard webpage pattern: container, date, URL.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Starting with the website name instead of the title.<br />
  Starting with <em>HuffPost</em> can make it harder to alphabetize because many entries would begin the same way. MLA’s approach, and your rule set, keeps the list more useful.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-for-citing-huffpost-accurately">
<h2 >Practical tips for citing HuffPost accurately</h2>
<h3 id="confirm-the-author-line-carefully">Confirm the author line carefully</h3>
<p>HuffPost pages sometimes show staff labels, contributor labels, or updated bylines. Use the author name shown on the article itself. If there are multiple contributors, apply your two author or et al. rules.</p>
<h3 id="use-the-date-that-matches-the-article">Use the date that matches the article</h3>
<p>Some pages show “Updated” information. If both original publication and update dates appear, MLA commonly uses the publication date shown with the article. If your class prefers the most recent update, be consistent and consider noting it in your text. In Works Cited, you usually include one date, not both.</p>
<h3 id="keep-punctuation-consistent">Keep punctuation consistent</h3>
<p>MLA punctuation is part of the format. Watch for these details:<br />
- Period after the author.<br />
- Article title in quotes, then a period inside the closing quote.<br />
- Website name in italics, followed by a comma.<br />
- Date followed by a comma.<br />
- URL ends with a period only if your style guide requires it. Many MLA examples omit the final period after a URL to avoid confusion. If your instructor expects a final period, use it consistently.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-add-extra-fields-unless-needed">Do not add extra fields unless needed</h3>
<p>You usually do not need “Publisher” for a HuffPost webpage citation in MLA style because the website name already functions as the container, and listing the same organization again can be redundant. If your institution has a rule to include the publisher, apply it consistently across all websites.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-overall">
<h2 >Why these rules matter overall</h2>
<p>These HuffPost citation rules are not just about appearance. They help readers:<br />
- <strong>Locate sources quickly</strong> by using predictable ordering and consistent punctuation.<br />
- <strong>Evaluate credibility</strong> by seeing author names and publication dates clearly.<br />
- <strong>Avoid confusion</strong> when multiple articles share similar titles or when authors have similar names.<br />
- <strong>Follow academic fairness</strong> by crediting authors in a consistent, respectful way, especially when full first names are used.</p>
<p>If you want, share one or two real HuffPost URLs you are using, and I can format them exactly in your guide’s style, including applying the full first name rule based on what the page shows.</p>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Huffpost citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-huffpost-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes HuffPost citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>HuffPost articles look like standard web pages, but they often include details that create citation edge cases. Common complications include changing section labels, frequent updates, multiple contributors, missing bylines, and pages that live on subdomains or special verticals. MLA 9 is flexible, but you still need consistent formatting so readers can find the exact page you used.</p>
<p>Your special rules about author names matter most with HuffPost because bylines can be inconsistent. Sometimes you get a full name, sometimes a staff label, sometimes a long list of contributors. Applying the same author rules each time keeps your Works Cited clear and alphabetized correctly.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-template-for-a-huffpost-article">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 template for a HuffPost article</h2>
<p>Use this as your baseline, then adjust for edge cases:</p>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Article." <em>HuffPost</em>, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Notes:<br />
- The website name is usually <em>HuffPost</em> (italicized).<br />
- Include the publication date if shown.<br />
- MLA 9 allows URLs without “https://,” but either is acceptable if consistent.<br />
- Access dates are optional in MLA 9, but they are often helpful for HuffPost because pages can be updated or moved.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-with-authors">
<h2 >Special cases with authors</h2>
<h3 id="one-author-with-a-standard-byline">One author with a standard byline</h3>
<p>Follow your rule: full first name, first author inverted.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
Last, First Middle. "Title." <em>HuffPost</em>, Date, URL.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If the byline uses a middle initial, try to find the author bio page or another reliable place on the site that shows the full middle name. If you cannot confirm it, do not invent it. Use what the page provides, but keep the first name fully spelled if it appears that way.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>Use your rule exactly. First author inverted, second author normal order, joined by <strong>and</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
Last, First Middle, and First Last. "Title." <em>HuffPost</em>, Date, URL.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Many citation tools invert both names. That is wrong under your rules and also not MLA standard.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>Use your rule: first author only, then <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list additional authors.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
Last, First Middle, et al. "Title." <em>HuffPost</em>, Date, URL.</p>
<p>Why this matters: HuffPost sometimes lists multiple contributors or adds “with” credits. Listing everyone can clutter the entry and makes alphabetizing harder. Using et al. keeps the focus on retrieval and consistency.</p>
<h3 id="organization-or-staff-labels-as-the-author">Organization or staff labels as the “author”</h3>
<p>HuffPost sometimes uses bylines like “HuffPost Staff” or “HuffPost.” MLA allows a corporate author, but treat it carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the byline is clearly a group name, you can use it as the author.</li>
<li>If the byline is missing entirely, use the title first (see “No author” below).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example of group author</strong><br />
HuffPost Staff. "Title." <em>HuffPost</em>, Date, URL.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Do not force a person’s name if the page does not credit one. Accuracy is more important than guessing.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-at-all">No author at all</h3>
<p>Use your rule: start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
"Title of Article." <em>HuffPost</em>, Date, URL.</p>
<p>Alphabetization tip: Ignore A, An, The when alphabetizing, but keep them in the title as written.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-updates-and-last-modified-issues">
<h2 >Dates, updates, and “last modified” issues</h2>
<h3 id="when-the-article-shows-both-published-and-updated">When the article shows both “published” and “updated”</h3>
<p>HuffPost frequently displays an update note. MLA 9 says you should cite the version you used. If the page clearly shows an updated date and your argument depends on the most current version, use the updated date as the publication date element.</p>
<p>If you are discussing the original release or the update is not clearly tied to the main date line, you can use the original date and add an access date.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If the update matters, mention it in your prose, not necessarily in the Works Cited. MLA citations are meant to help readers locate sources, not to record every change log detail.</p>
<h3 id="when-there-is-no-clear-date">When there is no clear date</h3>
<p>Some pages, especially older content, can have missing or unclear dates. In MLA 9, if no date is provided, you can omit the date and include an access date.</p>
<p>Do not insert “n.d.” under your rules.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
Author. "Title." <em>HuffPost</em>, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Students add a guessed year based on comments or social media shares. Do not do that.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="urls-paywalls-and-regional-versions">
<h2 >URLs, paywalls, and regional versions</h2>
<h3 id="long-urls-with-tracking-parameters">Long URLs with tracking parameters</h3>
<p>HuffPost links often include tracking codes. MLA prefers clean, stable URLs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove obvious tracking parameters when possible.</li>
<li>Keep enough of the URL to reach the page reliably.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: Clean URLs reduce broken links and make your citation easier to read.</p>
<h3 id="amp-pages-mobile-pages-and-duplicates">AMP pages, mobile pages, and duplicates</h3>
<p>You might land on an AMP version or a mobile version. Prefer the canonical page if you can find it, but citing the URL you actually used is acceptable. Consistency matters more than perfection, as long as the link works.</p>
<h3 id="international-editions-and-subdomains">International editions and subdomains</h3>
<p>HuffPost has used regional editions and subdomains. Use the site name as it appears on the page, usually still <em>HuffPost</em>. The URL will show the edition, which helps readers locate it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-sections-and-formatting-details">
<h2 >Titles, sections, and formatting details</h2>
<h3 id="article-titles-versus-page-headers">Article titles versus page headers</h3>
<p>Sometimes the headline and the browser tab title differ slightly. Use the article headline displayed on the page.</p>
<h3 id="sections-like-politics-entertainment-life">Sections like Politics, Entertainment, Life</h3>
<p>Do not treat the section name as the publisher or as a container by default. In MLA 9, the container for a web article is typically the website name, which is <em>HuffPost</em>. A section label is usually not needed unless it helps identify the page and functions like a distinct site or series.</p>

Smith, Jordan Michael. "How Cities Are Rethinking Public Transit After 2020." <em>HuffPost</em>, 14 Mar. 2023, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cities-public-transit-after-2020.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- The author is inverted, Smith, Jordan Michael, which supports alphabetical sorting in the Works Cited.<br />
- The article title is in quotation marks because it is a short work within a larger container.<br />
- <em>HuffPost</em> is italicized as the container.<br />
- The date is in Day Month Year format, which is MLA style.<br />
- The URL is included to help the reader locate the exact page.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Writing “Jordan M. Smith” or “J. M. Smith.” Your rules require full first names, and MLA generally prefers fuller identification when available.</p>

<h2 >Example 2, two authors, proper name order with “and”</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Garcia, Elena Rose, and Marcus Bennett. "What New Climate Data Means for Coastal Homeowners." <em>HuffPost</em>, 2 Aug. 2022, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-climate-data-coastal-homeowners.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- Only the first author is inverted. The second author stays in normal order, Marcus Bennett.<br />
- “and” is used between authors, which matches MLA practice and your rule.<br />
- This format prevents a common formatting error where both authors are inverted, which can confuse readers and disrupt alphabetization.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If a citation generator outputs “Bennett, Marcus,” as the second author, fix it manually.</p>

<h2 >Example 3, no author, updated or unstable content, include access date</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
"Inside the Debate Over Social Media Age Limits." <em>HuffPost</em>, 9 Sept. 2021, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/social-media-age-limits. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- There is no author, so the citation begins with the title.<br />
- The access date is included because web pages can be revised, relocated, or display different update information over time. This helps explain what version you consulted.<br />
- The title remains in quotation marks, and the container <em>HuffPost</em> is italicized.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Starting with “HuffPost” as the author when no byline exists. If the page does not credit “HuffPost” or “HuffPost Staff” as the author, treat it as no author and start with the title.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-huffpost-article-in-mla-format">How do I cite a HuffPost article in MLA format?</h3>
<p>To cite a HuffPost article in MLA 9, start with the author’s name (Last, First). Then put the article title in quotation marks, followed by the site name in italics, which is typically HuffPost. Add the publisher only if it is different from the website name, often you can omit it for HuffPost. Include the publication date, then the URL without https://. End with the access date only if your instructor requires it or the content is likely to change. Example scenario, you are citing a news analysis you read for a current events essay. In-text, use (Author Last Name) or ("Short Title") if no author. For more guidance, see the MLA Works Cited basics at https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-huffpost-article-has-no-author-listed-how-do-i-cite-it-in-mla">What if the HuffPost article has no author listed, how do I cite it in MLA?</h3>
<p>If a HuffPost article has no named author, begin the Works Cited entry with the article title in quotation marks. Then list HuffPost in italics, the publication date, and the URL. In-text, cite the first words of the title in quotation marks, for example ("How Climate Policy") rather than using a corporate author unless the page clearly credits an organization like “HuffPost Staff.” Practical scenario, you are using a breaking news brief that only shows a title and date. Check carefully for an author near the headline, at the end of the article, or in the page metadata. If it says “HuffPost Staff,” you can use that as the author. For MLA rules on unknown authors, consult https://style.mla.org/no-author/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-cite-huffpost-or-huffington-post-and-what-if-the-page-shows-a-different-section-name">Should I cite HuffPost or Huffington Post, and what if the page shows a different section name?</h3>
<p>Use the website name as it appears on the page. Most current pages use HuffPost, so italicize HuffPost as the container title in your Works Cited entry. If an older page or an archived copy displays Huffington Post, you can use that form instead, consistency and accuracy matter. Do not replace the site name with a section label like Politics or Entertainment, those are usually not the container. Practical scenario, you found an older article shared in a blog post that still displays “The Huffington Post.” In that case, cite it as The Huffington Post in italics. If your instructor prefers modernization, ask before standardizing. For container guidance, see https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-huffpost-article-i-found-through-google-news-or-apple-news-in-mla">How do I cite a HuffPost article I found through Google News or Apple News in MLA?</h3>
<p>Cite the original HuffPost page whenever possible, not the aggregator’s preview. Open the story and copy the URL from HuffPost, then build your Works Cited entry with author, title, HuffPost, date, and URL. Practical scenario, you read a HuffPost article inside Apple News, but you need a stable source link for your bibliography. Use the “open in browser” option to reach the HuffPost page and cite that. If you truly cannot access the original, you may cite the aggregator as the container and include the HuffPost title and other details you can verify, but this is less ideal. In-text citations still point to the author or title. For MLA advice on citing works found in databases and platforms, see https://style.mla.org/citing-database-articles/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-an-access-date-for-a-huffpost-citation-and-when-should-i-include-it">Do I need an access date for a HuffPost citation, and when should I include it?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but they are useful when content can change, when no publication date is listed, or when your instructor requires them. HuffPost articles usually include a publication date and sometimes an updated timestamp. If the page shows “Updated,” you can cite the publication date provided, and you may add the access date to document when you viewed the current version. Practical scenario, you cite an article that was updated after a major event, and you want to show the version you consulted for your argument. Add “Accessed Day Month Year.” If you use a permalink and the date is clear, you can often omit access. See MLA’s date guidance at https://style.mla.org/using-access-dates/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-huffpost-video-or-embedded-content-in-mla-like-a-youtube-clip-on-the-page">How do I cite a HuffPost video or embedded content in MLA, like a YouTube clip on the page?</h3>
<p>First decide what you are actually using as evidence. If you are analyzing the HuffPost page as a publication, cite the HuffPost page, and describe the media type if helpful, for example “Video.” If you are analyzing the embedded video itself, cite the original source, often YouTube, not HuffPost, because the creator and platform matter. Practical scenario, a HuffPost article embeds a YouTube interview, and you quote a statement from the video. Cite the YouTube video in your Works Cited, and in your prose you can mention it was embedded in a HuffPost article. If you also quote text from the HuffPost article, include a separate HuffPost citation. For MLA rules on online videos, see https://style.mla.org/citing-online-videos/.</p>
