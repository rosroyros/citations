<h2 >Citing Shakespeare’s Plays in MLA 9, What You Are Actually Citing</h2>
<p>When you cite Shakespeare, you are usually citing one of two things.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The play as a work in a specific edition</strong>, such as a printed book, an ebook, or an online text. This is what goes in your <strong>Works Cited</strong> entry.</li>
<li><strong>A specific passage from the play</strong>, which you point to in your <strong>in-text citation</strong> using act, scene, and line numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>MLA 9 expects you to identify the version you used because different editions can have different editors, different line numbering, and different page layouts. Your reader needs to be able to find the same passage you used with minimal effort.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-mla-9-pattern-for-a-play-works-cited">
<h2 >The Core MLA 9 Pattern for a Play (Works Cited)</h2>
<p>A common Works Cited format for a play in a book looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Author. <em>Title of Play</em>. Title of Container, edited by Editor Name, Publisher, Year, page range.</strong></p>
<p>For Shakespeare, the author is almost always <strong>William Shakespeare</strong>, but you still follow MLA’s author rules.</p>
<h3 id="author-name-rules-your-required-rules-applied">Author Name Rules (Your Required Rules Applied)</h3>
<p>Use these rules exactly, including full first names.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First author is inverted</strong>: Last, First Middle.</li>
<li>Example: <strong>Shakespeare, William.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: first author inverted, second author normal order, use <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li>Example: <strong>Smith, John and Maria Lopez.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: first author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>Example: <strong>Smith, John et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: start with the title, do not use Anonymous or n.d. Ignore A, An, The for alphabetizing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, Shakespeare is the only author, so your entry begins:</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare, William.</strong></p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="title-rules-for-shakespeares-plays">
<h2 >Title Rules for Shakespeare’s Plays</h2>
<ul>
<li>The title of the play is a <strong>standalone work</strong>, so it is <strong>italicized</strong> in MLA.</li>
<li>Example: <em>Macbeth</em></li>
<li>Capitalize major words in the title.</li>
<li>Do not put the play title in quotation marks in the Works Cited entry.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="containers-editors-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Containers, Editors, and Why They Matter</h2>
<p>In MLA, the “container” is the larger source that holds the play. Many students read Shakespeare in a collection, anthology, or edited volume. That means your citation often includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title of Container</strong> (italicized), such as <em>The Norton Shakespeare</em> or <em>The Riverside Shakespeare</em></li>
<li><strong>Editor(s)</strong>, introduced with <strong>edited by</strong></li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> and <strong>year</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Editors matter because edited Shakespeare editions vary. Editors choose spelling, punctuation, footnotes, introductions, and sometimes even line numbering systems. If your reader uses a different edition, they might not find your passage easily. Naming the editor and container makes your source traceable.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="in-text-citations-for-shakespeare-acts-scenes-and-lines">
<h2 >In-Text Citations for Shakespeare, Acts, Scenes, and Lines</h2>
<p>MLA usually prefers page numbers, but for plays, especially Shakespeare, MLA allows and encourages <strong>division numbers</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="standard-shakespeare-in-text-format">Standard Shakespeare In-Text Format</h3>
<p>Use <strong>act.scene.lines</strong> separated by periods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: (1.3.65–67)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you include Shakespeare’s name in the sentence, you usually only need the numbers in parentheses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Macbeth admits his ambition is dangerous (1.7.25–28).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not name the play or author in your sentence, you may need the title (often abbreviated) plus the numbers, especially if you cite more than one play.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: (<em>Mac.</em> 1.7.25–28)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your instructor may have preferences for abbreviations, but MLA’s goal is consistency and clarity.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, William. <em>Macbeth</em>. Edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine, Folger Shakespeare Library, 2013.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: Shakespeare’s name is inverted, last name first, then full first name.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: <em>Macbeth</em> is italicized because it is a complete work.</li>
<li><strong>Editors</strong>: Listed because this edition is edited. Editors are introduced with <strong>Edited by</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher and year</strong>: Included so readers can locate the exact edition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-example">In-text citation example</h3>
<p>Macbeth recognizes that Duncan’s murder would have consequences beyond the moment (1.7.7–12).</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If your edition uses line numbers, act, scene, and line citations are more helpful than page numbers because they stay meaningful across many editions. If your edition does not provide line numbers, use page numbers instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-a-play-from-an-anthology-or-collected-works-container-citation">
<h2 >Example 2, A Play from an Anthology or Collected Works (Container Citation)</h2>
<p>Many students cite Shakespeare from a book that contains many plays. In that case, the play is inside a container, and you often include page numbers for the play’s location in that book.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Shakespeare, William. <em>Hamlet</em>. <em>The Norton Shakespeare</em>, edited by Stephen Greenblatt, W. W. Norton, 2016, pp. 1659–1758.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play title first</strong>: You name the specific play you used, not just the anthology.</li>
<li><strong>Container title</strong>: <em>The Norton Shakespeare</em> is italicized as the book that contains the play.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>: Included because the container is edited.</li>
<li><strong>Page range</strong>: Helpful because the play is part of a larger book, and the page range shows where it appears.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-example">In-text citation example</h3>
<p>Hamlet’s wording shows disgust and moral frustration with the world around him (1.2.133–136).</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not cite only the anthology title in your Works Cited if you are analyzing a specific play. Your reader should see <em>Hamlet</em> as the entry’s main title.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-a-play-found-on-a-website-online-container">
<h2 >Example 3, A Play Found on a Website (Online Container)</h2>
<p>If you read Shakespeare online, you cite the play as it appears in the website container. MLA 9 often includes a URL, and you may also include an access date if the content is likely to change.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Shakespeare, William. <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. <em>MIT Shakespeare</em>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author and title</strong>: Still listed first, still italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Website as container</strong>: <em>MIT Shakespeare</em> is the container, italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher or sponsor</strong>: Massachusetts Institute of Technology is listed as the site’s publisher or sponsoring organization.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: Included to help readers find the exact page.</li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong>: Useful for web sources because pages can be updated, reorganized, or removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-example">In-text citation example</h3>
<p>Juliet’s language moves quickly from fear to determination as she anticipates the risk of her plan (4.3.14–20).</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>For online Shakespeare, act, scene, and line numbers are usually the best locator. If the site does not provide line numbers, cite act and scene, and add page numbers only if the site provides stable page numbering, which is uncommon.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-clarity-consistency-respect">
<h2 >Why These Rules Matter, Clarity, Consistency, Respect</h2>
<p>These formatting rules are not just picky details.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Full names and consistent order make it easy to identify who wrote what. Your rule about full first names supports clear identification.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: MLA style is designed so every Works Cited entry follows a predictable pattern. Readers can scan quickly and find the key details.</li>
<li><strong>Traceability</strong>: Shakespeare exists in many editions and many online versions. Editors, containers, and publication details tell your reader exactly which text you used.</li>
<li><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: Accurate citations show where your evidence came from and help others verify or challenge your interpretation.</li>

<h2 >Common Pitfalls When Citing Shakespeare</h2>
<h3 id="mixing-page-numbers-with-line-numbers-incorrectly">Mixing page numbers with line numbers incorrectly</h3>
<p>If you cite act, scene, and line, do not add page numbers in the same parenthetical citation unless your instructor requests it. Choose one clear locator system.</p>
<h3 id="citing-the-wrong-author">Citing the wrong “author”</h3>
<p>Do not list the editor as the author. Editors go in the “edited by” role, unless you are citing the editor’s introduction or notes as your main source.</p>
<h3 id="forgetting-the-container">Forgetting the container</h3>
<p>If the play is inside a collected edition or website, the container is essential. Leaving it out makes the citation incomplete.</p>
<h3 id="using-inconsistent-abbreviations">Using inconsistent abbreviations</h3>
<p>If you abbreviate play titles in parentheses, keep the abbreviations consistent throughout your paper. If you cite more than one play, abbreviations become more important.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Shakespeare'S Plays citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="overview-what-makes-shakespeare-citations-special-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Overview, what makes Shakespeare citations “special” in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Shakespeare is cited a little differently from many other authors because readers often need to locate a passage in multiple editions, and because plays are commonly referenced by division numbers (act, scene, line) rather than by page number. MLA 9 supports this by letting you cite the play and the specific location in a consistent, edition aware way.</p>
<p>The edge cases usually come from three situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are using an edition that contains multiple plays, or edited material.</li>
<li>You are citing a digital version with no stable page numbers, or with multiple numbering systems.</li>
<li>You are citing something that is not the play text itself, such as a performance, a film adaptation, or an excerpt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your goal is to make it easy for a reader to find the exact passage, and to make it clear which version you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="works-cited-entry-basics-for-shakespeare-plays">
<h2 >Works Cited entry basics for Shakespeare plays</h2>
<h3 id="use-a-container-when-the-play-is-inside-a-book">Use a container when the play is inside a book</h3>
<p>If you read the play in an anthology or a complete works volume, the book is the container. Your Works Cited entry needs both the play title and the book details.</p>
<h3 id="use-the-editor-when-it-matters">Use the editor when it matters</h3>
<p>Most Shakespeare editions are edited. In MLA 9, editors are listed when they are important to identifying the version you used, which is almost always true for Shakespeare.</p>
<h3 id="author-name-rules-and-why-they-matter">Author name rules, and why they matter</h3>
<p>In most MLA situations, Shakespeare is the author and will be listed as:</p>
<p>Shakespeare, William.</p>
<p>Your rule set emphasizes full first names, and that is already satisfied here. It also requires inversion for the first author, which is also satisfied.</p>
<p>Where author rules become an edge case is when you are not citing Shakespeare as the author, for example, a scholarly essay about the play, a critical introduction, or an edited adaptation. In those cases, the author of the part you are using may be someone else, and you must apply the author formatting rules to that person.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="in-text-citations-the-key-special-case-is-act-scene-and-line">
<h2 >In text citations, the key special case is act, scene, and line</h2>
<h3 id="prefer-division-numbers-over-page-numbers-for-the-play-text">Prefer division numbers over page numbers for the play text</h3>
<p>When you quote or paraphrase from a play, MLA typically uses act, scene, and line numbers in parentheses. This stays consistent across editions, even when page numbers differ.</p>
<p>A common format is:<br />
(Shakespeare act.scene.lines)</p>
<p>Some instructors allow you to omit the author name in the parenthetical citation if it is clear from context, especially when your whole paper is on Shakespeare. If you omit it, make sure there is no ambiguity.</p>
<h3 id="use-arabic-numerals-separated-by-periods">Use Arabic numerals separated by periods</h3>
<p>MLA commonly presents the divisions as Arabic numerals with periods, for example 1.3.55-57. Avoid mixing systems, such as writing “Act I, scene iii.” Use one consistent style.</p>
<h3 id="when-line-numbers-are-missing">When line numbers are missing</h3>
<p>Some online texts do not include line numbers, or they vary by display settings. In that case, use the most stable locator available, such as act and scene only, or act, scene, and a line range if the site provides it. If you must use page numbers, use the page numbers from your specific edition, but understand that page numbers are less portable than line numbers.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-and-edge-cases-in-the-works-cited-list">
<h2 >Special cases and edge cases in the Works Cited list</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-play-in-a-single-edition-versus-the-play-in-a-complete-works-volume">1. The play in a single edition versus the play in a complete works volume</h3>
<p>If you use a standalone edition, the play title is usually the title of the book, so you cite it like a book. If you use a complete works or anthology, the play is a work within a larger book, so you cite the play as a part of the container.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Look at your title page. If the book title is the play title, it is likely a standalone edition. If the book title is something like The Norton Shakespeare or The Complete Works, then the play is inside a container.</p>
<h3 id="2-multiple-editors-or-corporate-editorial-teams">2. Multiple editors or corporate editorial teams</h3>
<p>Some editions list more than one editor. MLA lets you list editors after the title. If there are two editors, include both. If there are three or more, you can list the first editor followed by “et al.” If you do this, apply your “three or more” rule consistently.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Confusing “edited by” with “translated by” or “adapted by.” Shakespeare is in English, so translation is rare in English language classes, but adaptations are common in performance contexts.</p>
<h3 id="3-citing-a-scholarly-introduction-footnote-or-essay-in-the-edition">3. Citing a scholarly introduction, footnote, or essay in the edition</h3>
<p>Many Shakespeare editions include an introduction by the editor, plus explanatory notes. If you quote from the introduction, you are not citing Shakespeare’s play text. You are citing the introduction as a separate work within the book.</p>
<p>This is a major edge case because your in text citation changes. Instead of act, scene, and line, you often cite the introduction’s page number, and you use the introduction author’s name.</p>
<h3 id="4-digital-shakespeare-texts-and-unstable-urls">4. Digital Shakespeare texts, and unstable URLs</h3>
<p>Online Shakespeare texts can be tricky because URLs change and some sites do not provide stable line numbering. MLA 9 encourages you to cite the website as the container, include the publisher or sponsor, and provide a URL. You can add an access date if the content is likely to change, which is common for websites.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Prefer reputable editions that provide line numbering, such as academic sites or digitizations of print editions. If a site provides a “cite this” tool, check it carefully, then correct it to MLA 9 style.</p>
<h3 id="5-performances-and-films-which-are-not-the-same-as-the-play-text">5. Performances and films, which are not the same as the play text</h3>
<p>If you are analyzing a performance, you should cite the performance as the source, not the play. Your in text citation will usually use time stamps, if available, or other identifiers. The Works Cited entry will list the performance title, director, performers if relevant, the platform, and the date.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Quoting a line spoken in a film and citing act, scene, and line as if you consulted the written play. If your evidence is the film, cite the film. If your evidence is the written text, cite the text.</p>

<p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />
Shakespeare, William. <em>Macbeth</em>. Edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine, <em>The Folger Shakespeare</em>, Simon and Schuster, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>In text citation</strong><br />
(Macbeth 1.7.1-4)</p>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- The author is listed as Shakespeare, William, with the first author inverted.<br />
- The title of the play is italicized because it is a complete work.<br />
- The editors are included because they identify the specific text and notes you used.<br />
- The in text citation uses act.scene.line numbers, which helps readers find the passage in other editions.<br />
- The parenthetical citation uses the play title because the paper context often makes Shakespeare obvious, and many MLA instructors accept this for Shakespeare. If your instructor prefers, you can use (Shakespeare 1.7.1-4).</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not cite a page number when line numbers are available.<br />
- Do not treat the editor as the author of the play.</p>

<h2 >Example 2, Citing an introduction written by the editor, not the play text</h2>
<p>Imagine you quote an argument from the introduction in your Shakespeare edition.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />
Mowat, Barbara A., and Paul Werstine. “Introduction.” <em>Macbeth</em>. By William Shakespeare, edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine, <em>The Folger Shakespeare</em>, Simon and Schuster, 2013, pp. xiii-xxx.</p>
<p><strong>In text citation</strong><br />
(Mowat and Werstine xvi)</p>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- The introduction has its own title in quotation marks because it is a part of a larger work.<br />
- The introduction’s authors are listed first, with the first author inverted, and the second author in normal order, matching your two author rule.<br />
- The container is the play edition, which is identified as <em>Macbeth</em> and then the larger series, if you include it as part of the container information.<br />
- The in text citation uses the introduction authors and the page number, because introductions do not have act, scene, and line numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not cite the introduction as if Shakespeare wrote it.<br />
- Do not use act and scene numbers for editorial material.</p>

<h2 >Example 3, A Shakespeare play from a website, with line numbers that may vary</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />
Shakespeare, William. <em>Hamlet</em>. <em>MIT Shakespeare</em>, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.html. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>In text citation</strong><br />
(Hamlet 3.1.55-60)</p>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- The author and title are clear and properly formatted.<br />
- The website is the container, and the site sponsor is listed.<br />
- The URL is included without “https://” as MLA commonly allows, and an access date is added because web content can change.<br />
- The in text citation uses act.scene.line. If the site does not provide stable line numbers, you may need to cite act and scene only, then quote enough text to make the passage easy to find.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not rely on a browser page number, it is not meaningful to readers.<br />
- Do not omit the container website, it helps readers find the exact version you used.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips for getting Shakespeare citations right</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="choose-one-reliable-edition-and-stick-to-it">
<h2 >Choose one reliable edition and stick to it</h2>
<p>Mixing editions can create confusion because wording, punctuation, and line numbering can vary. If you must use more than one edition, make that clear in your Works Cited and be consistent in your in text citations.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="use-line-numbers-whenever-possible">
<h2 >Use line numbers whenever possible</h2>
<p>Line numbers are the most reader friendly locator for plays. If your edition provides them, use them.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="clarify-abbreviations-early-if-you-cite-multiple-plays">
<h2 >Clarify abbreviations early if you cite multiple plays</h2>
<p>If you cite several Shakespeare plays, you can introduce abbreviations in your text, then use them consistently, for example, “In <em>King Lear</em> (hereafter <em>Lear</em>).” Keep abbreviations intuitive.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="double-check-what-you-are-actually-citing">
<h2 >Double check what you are actually citing</h2>
<p>Ask yourself, “Is my evidence from the play text, from an editor’s note, from an introduction, or from a performance?” Then match both the Works Cited entry and the in text locator to that source type.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>MLA citation is not just formatting. It is a navigation system for readers. With Shakespeare, the same play exists in many editions, and small differences can change interpretation. Using the correct container information, editors, and act.scene.line locators makes your evidence verifiable. It also demonstrates academic care, since Shakespeare studies depend heavily on precise textual reference.</p>
<p>If you tell me which edition or website you are using, I can format a Works Cited entry and a matching in text citation for that exact source, including any editors, volume titles, or database containers.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-quote-from-shakespeare-in-mla-and-do-i-use-page-numbers-or-act-scene-and-line-numbers">How do I cite a quote from Shakespeare in MLA, and do I use page numbers or act, scene, and line numbers?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, cite Shakespeare by division numbers, not by page number, unless your instructor specifically requires pages. Most editions provide act, scene, and line numbers, so your in-text citation usually looks like (Shakespeare 1.3.55-57). If you name the play in the sentence, you can omit the author: (1.3.55-57). Use Arabic numerals separated by periods, and use a hyphen for a line range. If your edition only has page numbers, cite the page: (Shakespeare 84). In your Works Cited, list the edition you used, because line numbering can vary by editor. Practical scenario: if you copy a line from a classroom anthology, cite that anthology as the container, then use act, scene, and line numbers in the in-text citation. For more guidance, see MLA on in-text citations: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-format-a-works-cited-entry-for-a-shakespeare-play-from-a-book-like-a-norton-or-arden-edition">How do I format a Works Cited entry for a Shakespeare play from a book, like a Norton or Arden edition?</h3>
<p>For a printed edition, your Works Cited entry should identify the play, the author, the editor or translator if relevant, the publisher, and the year. A common format is: Shakespeare, William. Macbeth. Edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine, Folger Shakespeare Library, Simon and Schuster, 2013. If the play appears inside a collection, cite the play as the work, then the book as the container, plus page range. Practical scenario: if you used Hamlet in The Norton Shakespeare, cite Hamlet first, then cite the Norton book details and the page span for Hamlet. Your in-text citations still use act, scene, and line numbers, even if you found the passage on a particular page. For detailed MLA book templates, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-shakespeare-if-i-found-the-play-online-like-mit-shakespeare-open-source-shakespeare-or-folger-digital-texts">How do I cite Shakespeare if I found the play online, like MIT Shakespeare, Open Source Shakespeare, or Folger Digital Texts?</h3>
<p>For an online play, cite the web source you actually used, because wording, line numbering, and editorial notes can differ. In Works Cited, include Author, Play Title, Website Title, publisher or sponsor (if given), publication or last update date (if available), URL, and access date if your instructor wants it. Example pattern: Shakespeare, William. Romeo and Juliet. Folger Shakespeare, Folger Shakespeare Library, https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/romeo-and-juliet/. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026. For in-text citations, still use act, scene, and line numbers when the site provides them. If the site does not provide line numbers, cite act and scene, or use page or paragraph numbers if available. MLA web guidance: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-put-shakespeares-name-in-every-in-text-citation-or-can-i-just-use-act-scene-and-line-numbers">Do I need to put Shakespeare’s name in every in-text citation, or can I just use act, scene, and line numbers?</h3>
<p>You do not always need Shakespeare’s name in every parenthetical citation. If your paper focuses on one play and the context is clear, you can use only the division numbers after the first full reference, for example (2.1.12-15). If you discuss multiple plays, include a shortened title to avoid confusion, such as (Ham. 3.1.56-58) and (Mac. 1.7.1-3). Your instructor may prefer one system, but MLA allows flexibility as long as your citations clearly point to the correct entry in Works Cited. Practical scenario: if you compare Hamlet and Macbeth in the same paragraph, use abbreviations consistently and include a key in your Works Cited or in a note if needed. For MLA principles on clarity in citations, see: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-stage-directions-and-line-breaks-when-quoting-shakespeare-in-mla">How do I cite stage directions and line breaks when quoting Shakespeare in MLA?</h3>
<p>Stage directions are cited like dialogue, using act, scene, and line numbers if your edition numbers them. If you quote a stage direction alone, keep it in quotation marks in your sentence, and cite the location, for example (“Exit Ghost” 1.5.115). If you incorporate a stage direction into your own sentence, you can keep it unquoted if it reads smoothly, but many instructors prefer it quoted to show it is from the text. For line breaks, use a slash to mark line breaks in short quotations of verse, with spaces on both sides: “To be, or not to be, that is the question / Whether ’tis nobler” (3.1.56-57). For longer verse or dialogue, use a block quote and preserve line breaks, then cite the division numbers after the final punctuation. MLA quoting guidance: https://style.mla.org/block-quotes/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-shakespeare-in-a-paper-that-uses-different-editions-or-when-the-line-numbers-do-not-match-my-classmates">How do I cite Shakespeare in a paper that uses different editions, or when the line numbers do not match my classmate’s?</h3>
<p>Line numbering can differ between editions, so your Works Cited must identify the exact edition or website you used. Use the act, scene, and line numbers from your source, even if they differ from someone else’s, because your citations should lead readers to your text. Practical scenario: you quote Othello from an online text for homework, but your essay uses a print Arden edition. Either switch to one consistent edition for the essay, or cite each quote to the edition it came from, with separate Works Cited entries. In your writing, you can clarify in a note which editions you used if confusion is likely. If your source lacks line numbers, cite act and scene, then add page or paragraph numbers if available.
