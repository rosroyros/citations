<section class="content-section" id="what-mla-9-requires-for-citing-twitter-now-x-posts">
<h2 >What MLA 9 requires for citing Twitter (now X) posts</h2>
<p>In MLA 9th edition, a post on Twitter, now called X, is treated like a short work found inside a larger container. The individual post is the item you are citing, and the platform, X, is the container where it appears. Your goal is to help a reader locate the exact post quickly, while also giving proper credit to the person or organization who wrote it.</p>
<p>A standard MLA Works Cited entry for an X post usually includes these parts, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Author</strong> (the account holder who posted)</li>
<li><strong>Text of the post</strong> (as the title, in quotation marks)</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> (X, in italics)</li>
<li><strong>Date and time</strong> (when provided)</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong> (a direct link to the post)</li>
</ol>
<p>In most student papers, you will cite a single post, not an entire profile. You can still cite profiles or threads, but the typical assignment asks for one post as evidence.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-for-x-citations-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules for X citations (and why they matter)</h2>
<h3 id="use-full-first-names-not-initials">Use full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>You requested a rule that <strong>author names must use full first names, not initials</strong>. This matters because it improves clarity and avoids confusion between people with similar names. It also supports accurate attribution.</p>
<p>Practical note: X accounts often show a display name and a handle. MLA citations usually use the name as presented by the author. If you can identify the full first name from the profile, use it. If the account only shows a single word, a brand name, or a handle, you may not be able to supply a full first name. In that case, cite what is available, because MLA does not expect you to invent names.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-name-must-be-inverted">First author name must be inverted</h3>
<p>For Works Cited alphabetizing, MLA uses inverted order for the first author:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This matters because Works Cited entries are sorted alphabetically, and inversion makes the last name the key sorting element.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-and-do-not-invert-the-second-name">Two authors, use “and” and do not invert the second name</h3>
<p>If a post is credited to two authors (uncommon on X, but possible for organizational accounts or co authored content elsewhere), MLA format is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle, and First Last</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This matters because MLA has a consistent pattern across source types, and it keeps the citation readable.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Three or more authors, use “et al.”</h3>
<p>If there are three or more authors, list only the first author, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list additional authors before et al.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This matters because it prevents long, cluttered citations while still identifying the source.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title-of-the-post">No author, start with the title of the post</h3>
<p>If there is no identifiable author, begin with the title element, which for an X post is the text of the post in quotation marks. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<p>This matters because MLA prioritizes what the reader can verify. If you cannot verify an author, you should not guess.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="how-to-format-the-title-for-an-x-post">
<h2 >How to format the “title” for an X post</h2>
<p>MLA treats a social media post as a short work, so the post’s text functions like a title and goes in <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</p>
<p>Guidelines:<br />
- Quote the <strong>entire post</strong> if it is short.<br />
- If it is long, quote a <strong>shortened version</strong> of the text, usually the first sentence or first meaningful phrase.<br />
- Keep spelling, capitalization, and punctuation as in the post, but you can omit extra content using an ellipsis if you are shortening.</p>
<p>Why this matters: the post text is often the quickest way for a reader to confirm they have found the correct content, especially if accounts post frequently.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="container-date-and-url-rules-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Container, date, and URL rules (and why they matter)</h2>
<h3 id="container-italicize-x">Container: italicize X</h3>
<p>After the post text, list the platform as the container:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>X</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This matters because MLA uses containers to show where a work is found. A post can be reposted or embedded elsewhere, so naming the container clarifies the original location.</p>
<h3 id="date-and-time">Date and time</h3>
<p>MLA prefers the date of publication. For X posts, you can include the timestamp if it is visible and relevant. Many instructors accept just the date, but including time can be helpful because posts can be edited, deleted, or reposted.</p>
<p>Why this matters: social media changes quickly. A precise date, and sometimes time, helps readers verify the post you used.</p>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>Use a direct URL to the post, not just the homepage of X or the account profile. MLA 9 allows URLs, and for social media sources, the URL is often essential for retrieval.</p>
<p>Why this matters: without the direct link, a reader may not be able to locate the post, especially if the account has many posts.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-single-author-post-most-common">
<h2 >Example 1, Single author post (most common)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Musk, Elon. “We are working on improving community notes coverage and speed.” <em>X</em>, 12 Oct. 2023, https://x.com/elonmusk/status/0000000000000000000.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: “Musk, Elon.” The first author is inverted. Full first name is used.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: The post text is in quotation marks because it is a short work.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: <em>X</em> is italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: Given in MLA day month year style, abbreviated month is standard in MLA.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: A direct link to the post allows the reader to find it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation">In text citation</h3>
<p>MLA in text citations usually use the author’s last name:<br />
- (Musk)</p>
<p>If you mention the author in your sentence, you may not need a parenthetical citation:<br />
- Musk argues that the platform is “working on improving community notes coverage and speed.”</p>
<p>Tip: If your Works Cited begins with a title because there is no author, your in text citation should use a shortened version of that title in quotation marks.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-no-author-available-start-with-the-post-text">
<h2 >Example 2, No author available (start with the post text)</h2>
<p>Sometimes a post may be shown in a screenshot, an embedded post, or a context where the author is not identifiable. If you cannot verify the author, start with the post text.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>“New update rolling out today, check your settings for the latest controls.” <em>X</em>, 3 May 2024, https://x.com/i/web/status/0000000000000000000.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: MLA does not want you to guess. You begin with the title element.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: The post text is still in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Container and date</strong>: <em>X</em> and the posting date help identify the source.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: Especially important when author data is missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation">In text citation</h3>
<p>Use a shortened version of the title:<br />
- (“New update rolling out”)</p>
<p>Practical tip: If you only have a screenshot and no URL, cite the screenshot as an image you created or an image you found, depending on your situation. If your assignment requires retrievable sources, try to locate the original post and use its URL.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">
<h2 >Example 3, Three or more authors (use et al.)</h2>
<p>This is rare for X posts, but it can occur when a post is credited to a group with multiple named creators, or when you are citing a collaborative announcement that lists multiple authors in the post metadata on another platform. If you truly have three or more authors, MLA uses et al.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Garcia, Elena Marisol, et al. “Our new dataset is now public, documentation is live, and feedback is welcome.” <em>X</em>, 18 Feb. 2025, https://x.com/example/status/0000000000000000000.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First author inverted</strong>: “Garcia, Elena Marisol.”</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: “et al.” replaces the remaining names.</li>

<p>If the account clearly lists a full name, use it. If it does not, do not invent one. Consistency and honesty are more important than forcing a format.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-2-forgetting-quotation-marks-around-the-post-text">Pitfall 2, Forgetting quotation marks around the post text</h3>
<p>The post text functions like a title for a short work, so it should be in quotation marks. Do not italicize the post text.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-3-linking-to-the-profile-instead-of-the-post">Pitfall 3, Linking to the profile instead of the post</h3>
<p>A profile link makes it hard to locate the exact post. Use the direct status URL whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-4-overquoting-a-long-post">Pitfall 4, Overquoting a long post</h3>
<p>If the post is long, shorten the title portion. Keep enough words to identify it, then use an ellipsis if needed.</p>
<h3 id="pitfall-5-mixing-up-x-and-twitter">Pitfall 5, Mixing up X and Twitter</h3>
<p>Use the platform name that best matches how you are presenting the source. If you are citing it as it exists now, <em>X</em> is appropriate. If your instructor prefers “Twitter,” follow your course guidance, but keep the container name consistent throughout your Works Cited.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-for-creating-accurate-x-citations">
<h2 >Practical tips for creating accurate X citations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open the post in a browser</strong> and copy the direct link from the address bar.</li>
<li><strong>Capture the date</strong> shown on the post. If time is visible and your instructor values precision, include it.</li>
<li><strong>Decide how much of the post text to use</strong> as the title. Aim for a clear, identifying snippet.</li>
<li><strong>Check your Works Cited alphabetizing</strong>. If you have an author, the entry is alphabetized by last name. If you have no author, alphabetize by the first significant word of the title, ignoring A, An, or The.</li>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Twitter (X) citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-twitter-x-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes Twitter (X) citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing posts on X looks simple until you hit real world problems, deleted posts, changing display names, missing dates, long threads, and screenshots. MLA 9 is flexible, but it still expects you to give readers enough information to find the post, understand who created it, and know when you accessed it.</p>
<p>These edge cases matter because social media content is unstable. Posts can be edited, accounts can be renamed, and links can break. Your goal is to document what you saw, where you saw it, and when you saw it, in a way that your reader can verify or at least understand the evidence you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-template-for-an-x-post">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 template for an X post</h2>
<p>A standard Works Cited entry for an X post often follows this pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Author. "Text of the post." <em>X</em>, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Key MLA 9 choices that affect special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong> is usually the account holder, not the platform.</li>
<li><strong>"Text of the post"</strong> acts like the title of a short work. Use the exact wording from the post, but you can shorten it if it is long, as long as you keep the meaning.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong> is the post date shown on X.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong> should be the direct link to the post.</li>
<li><strong>Accessed date</strong> is strongly recommended for social media because content changes or disappears.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-display-name-vs-handle-and-author-identity-problems">
<h2 >Special case 1, Display name vs. handle, and author identity problems</h2>
<h3 id="when-the-display-name-and-handle-do-not-match">When the display name and handle do not match</h3>
<p>On X, you usually see a display name and a handle. MLA cares most about the author name. In your guide, you require full first names and an inverted first author name. That means you should use the person or organization name as the author, then use the handle only if it helps identification, typically in the title or in an optional note.</p>
<p>Practical approach that stays clear:<br />
- Use the <strong>display name</strong> as the author when it is a real name or clear organization name.<br />
- If the account is known primarily by the handle, you can treat the handle as the author, but this can look odd in MLA because it is not a personal name. If you do this, keep it consistent and make sure the reader can locate the account.</p>
<h3 id="when-the-author-changes-their-display-name-later">When the author changes their display name later</h3>
<p>A reader might visit your link and see a different name. Your citation still reflects what you used. This is another reason to include an <strong>access date</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="when-the-post-is-from-a-verified-organization-or-a-brand">When the post is from a verified organization or a brand</h3>
<p>If the author is an organization, invert only if it reads like a personal name. Most organization names should be written in normal order.</p>
<p>Common pitfall:<br />
- Do not treat the platform as the author. “X” is the container, not the creator.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-multiple-authors-coauthored-posts-and-quoted-posts">
<h2 >Special case 2, Multiple authors, coauthored posts, and quoted posts</h2>
<p>X posts are usually single author, but you can still run into multi author situations:</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>Sometimes a post is explicitly coauthored, for example, a joint statement posted on one account, or a post that clearly lists two creators. If you truly have two authors, follow your rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>First author inverted, full first name.</li>
<li>Second author normal order, full first name.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>If three or more authors are credited, list only the first author, inverted, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the rest.</p>
<h3 id="quote-posts-and-reposts">Quote posts and reposts</h3>
<p>A quote post includes your author’s commentary plus embedded content from another account. Cite the post you are analyzing. If your discussion focuses on the embedded post, cite that original post instead, or cite both if you discuss both.</p>
<p>Common pitfall:<br />
- Citing the original post when you actually used the quote post’s added commentary, or the reverse.</p>

<h2 >Special case 3, Threads, reply chains, and “part of a conversation”</h2>
<h3 id="citing-a-single-post-inside-a-thread">Citing a single post inside a thread</h3>
<p>If you use one post, cite that one post with its direct URL.</p>
<h3 id="citing-an-entire-thread">Citing an entire thread</h3>
<p>MLA does not have a single perfect “thread” format, because threads are a series of posts. Two practical options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cite the first post</strong>, then explain in your prose that you are using the full thread.</li>
<li><strong>Cite multiple posts</strong> if specific posts matter, especially if later posts contain key claims or data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Practical tip:<br />
- If you cite only the first post but rely on later posts for evidence, your reader may not find the exact wording you quote. In that case, cite the specific post that contains your quoted material.</p>

<h2 >Special case 4, Missing dates, time zones, and edited content</h2>
<h3 id="missing-or-unclear-dates">Missing or unclear dates</h3>
<p>Most X posts show a date. If you are working from a screenshot, the date might be missing. MLA prefers you include a date when available. If you truly cannot determine it, omit the date and rely on the access date, but understand that this weakens verifiability.</p>
<h3 id="time-zones">Time zones</h3>
<p>MLA citations do not typically require time of day. If your argument depends on timing, you can mention the time zone in your discussion, not necessarily in the Works Cited entry.</p>
<h3 id="edited-posts">Edited posts</h3>
<p>X can allow edits in some contexts. If you suspect a post was edited and the exact wording matters, consider:<br />
- Quoting what you saw and including an access date.<br />
- Saving an archival link if permitted and stable.<br />
- Using a screenshot as supporting evidence, then citing the screenshot as an image if the original is unavailable.</p>

<p>You can still cite it, but readers may not be able to access it. Include the access date to show when it was available. You can also describe in your prose that the post has since been deleted.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-only-have-a-screenshot">If you only have a screenshot</h3>
<p>A screenshot is not the same as the post itself. Treat it like an image you created or an image you found, depending on context. In many academic settings, you should also explain in your prose that the post is no longer accessible and that you used a screenshot.</p>
<p>Common pitfall:<br />
- Citing a screenshot as if it were the live post, without clarifying that the original is unavailable.</p>

<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- The author name is presented as a full name and inverted for the first author, which supports alphabetizing in Works Cited.<br />
- The post text is in quotation marks because it is a short work.<br />
- <em>X</em> is italicized as the container.<br />
- The access date is included because posts can be edited or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong><br />
- If the post is long, shorten the quoted “title” to the first complete sentence or a meaningful phrase, but keep the original wording.</p>

<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- Two authors are listed, the first is inverted, the second is not inverted, and <strong>and</strong> connects them, matching your rules.<br />
- Even though the post appears on one account, the citation reflects the credited creators, which is what matters when authorship is explicit.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
- Listing the handle as a second author when it is not actually credited as a creator. Handles are identifiers, not automatically authors.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works</strong><br />
- When there is no author, MLA starts with the title. This lets the entry still be alphabetized and located.<br />
- You do not insert “Anonymous” or “n.d.” because MLA 9 does not require those fillers.<br />
- The direct URL is included so a reader can attempt to locate the post.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong><br />
- If you only have a screenshot and no URL, cite the screenshot as an image and explain in your text where it came from and why the original post cannot be accessed.</p>

<h2 >Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always use the direct post URL</strong>, not a profile URL or a search results page.</li>
<li><strong>Include an access date</strong> for social media, especially if your claim depends on exact wording.</li>
<li><strong>Cite the exact post you quote</strong>, especially in threads, where later posts may contain the key statement.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the post text accurate</strong>, preserve capitalization and phrasing, and use ellipses only if you are shortening the title portion.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the platform as author</strong>, for example, starting with “X.” The author is the account holder or credited creator.</li>
<li><strong>Dropping the access date</strong> for unstable sources.</li>
<li><strong>Citing a repost instead of the original</strong>, when your evidence comes from the original.</li>
<li><strong>Confusing handles with names</strong>, especially when the display name is a full name. Use the most informative form for readers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>These special case rules protect your credibility. A careful MLA citation for X shows that you can document unstable sources responsibly. It also helps readers trace your evidence, even if the content changes. Using full names and correct author formatting improves clarity, reduces confusion between accounts, and supports fair attribution, which is especially important on platforms where impersonation and name changes are common.</p>
<p>If you want, share one or two real X links you are citing, and I can format them into Works Cited entries that follow your author name rules exactly.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-tweet-in-mla-9-when-the-author-has-a-display-name-and-a-different-handle">How do I cite a tweet in MLA 9 when the author has a display name and a different @handle?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, treat the account as the author, and include both the real or display name and the username (handle) when available. Start the Works Cited entry with the account name as it appears, followed by the handle in square brackets, then the full text of the tweet in quotation marks. After that, list the platform (X, formerly Twitter), the date and time (include time if it helps identify the post), and the URL. Example scenario, you cite a post from “Taylor Lorenz” whose handle is @TaylorLorenz. Your entry begins “Lorenz, Taylor [@TaylorLorenz].” In your in text citation, use the author element, typically the account name, not the tweet text. For MLA guidance on social media and optional elements, see the MLA Works Cited core elements page: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and MLA’s social media guidance: https://style.mla.org/citing-social-media/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-tweet-if-the-account-name-is-missing-changed-or-the-user-is-anonymous">How do I cite a tweet if the account name is missing, changed, or the user is anonymous?</h3>
<p>If the account name is unavailable or clearly unreliable, begin the Works Cited entry with the tweet text in quotation marks, shortened if needed. Then list X, the date and time, and the URL. This is practical when an account is suspended, renamed, or the post is embedded without clear author data. If you can confirm the handle from the URL or the embedded post, include it as the author instead, because it improves traceability. For in text citations, use the first element of the Works Cited entry, often a shortened version of the tweet text in quotation marks. If the tweet is deleted and you only have a screenshot, cite the screenshot as an image you created or possess, and explain in the text that the original post is no longer available. For more on MLA entries when authors are unknown, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-retweet-quote-tweet-or-a-thread-and-do-i-cite-the-original-or-the-repost">How do I cite a retweet, quote tweet, or a thread, and do I cite the original or the repost?</h3>
<p>Cite what you actually used. If you are discussing the original statement, cite the original tweet by the original author, even if you encountered it through a retweet. If you are analyzing someone’s commentary in a quote tweet, cite the quote tweet, because it is a separate post with its own author and date. For threads, cite the specific tweet you are quoting, not just the first tweet, unless your discussion covers the entire thread and the first tweet is the best entry point. In practice, you might cite two items, the original tweet and the quote tweet, if you analyze both the original claim and the reaction. Include the direct URL to the specific tweet you reference, because thread links can be ambiguous. For MLA’s approach to social media posts and core elements, consult: https://style.mla.org/citing-social-media/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-should-i-do-if-a-tweet-has-no-title-and-do-i-need-to-include-the-full-tweet-text-in-the-works-cited-entry">What should I do if a tweet has no title, and do I need to include the full tweet text in the Works Cited entry?</h3>
<p>Tweets do not have formal titles, so MLA typically uses the tweet’s text as the title element, placed in quotation marks. You do not have to reproduce every character if it is very long, but you should include enough of the text to identify the post, and keep the wording exactly as posted for the portion you include. If the tweet begins with a link, a mention, or an emoji, you can still start with the text, but consider including the first meaningful words. For example, if a tweet is 280 characters and you only need the first sentence to identify it, you may truncate after a complete thought. Always include the URL to the specific tweet, since it functions like a stable locator. For formatting details and punctuation rules, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-embedded-tweet-in-a-news-article-and-should-i-cite-the-article-or-the-tweet">How do I cite an embedded tweet in a news article, and should I cite the article or the tweet?</h3>
<p>It depends on what you are using as evidence. If you are quoting or analyzing the tweet’s content, cite the tweet itself, even if you found it embedded in a news story. If you are discussing how the journalist framed the tweet, or the article’s reporting and context, cite the news article, and optionally cite the tweet as well if you quote it directly. Practical scenario, you write about how an article curated several posts to support a narrative. You might cite the article as your main source, then cite a specific embedded tweet that you quote. Use the tweet’s direct URL, not the article URL, for the tweet citation. If you cannot access the tweet page, cite the article and note in your prose that the tweet was viewed via embed. See MLA guidance on citing social media: https://style.mla.org/citing-social-media/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-tweet-i-accessed-through-a-screenshot-and-what-if-the-tweet-was-deleted-later">How do I cite a tweet I accessed through a screenshot, and what if the tweet was deleted later?</h3>
<p>If the tweet is deleted or you only have a screenshot, you can cite the screenshot as an image, because that is the version you consulted. In your Works Cited, list the creator as yourself if you took the screenshot, or the person who provided it if it was shared with you, then give a descriptive title such as “Screenshot of X post by @handle,” followed by the date you captured it, and the format, such as JPEG or PNG. In your text, explain that the original post was deleted or unavailable and that you are relying on a screenshot. If you still have the tweet URL, include it in the description, even if it no longer resolves, because it documents the original location. For MLA’s general rules on citing images and core elements, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
