<section class="content-section" id="what-poetry-foundation-is-and-why-it-matters-for-mla-9">
<h2 >What Poetry Foundation Is, and Why It Matters for MLA 9</h2>
<p>Poetry Foundation is a website that publishes poems, poet biographies, essays, and editorial content. In MLA 9, you cite Poetry Foundation the same way you cite most web sources, by identifying the core elements of the source and placing them in a consistent order. The goal is for a reader to locate the exact page you used and understand what you accessed, even if the site layout changes later.</p>
<p>Because Poetry Foundation pages can look similar, details like the poem title, the page title, the website name, and the URL matter. These details help a reader find the correct poem, confirm the text, and see any editorial context that might affect interpretation.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-core-elements-you-will-usually-use">
<h2 >MLA 9 Core Elements You Will Usually Use</h2>
<p>When you cite a Poetry Foundation page, you typically build the citation from these elements, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Author</strong> (if listed for the page)</li>
<li><strong>Title of source</strong> (the specific page, usually the poem title or article title)</li>
<li><strong>Title of container</strong> (the website name, usually <em>Poetry Foundation</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> (often omitted for websites when it is the same as the container, or when it is not clearly stated)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong> (if shown)</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong> (optional in MLA, but often smart for web pages that can change)</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, Poetry Foundation citations most often look like:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Page.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Not every page has every element. MLA 9 is flexible, you include what is available and useful.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-based-on-your-requirements">
<h2 >Author Rules You Must Follow (Based on Your Requirements)</h2>
<p>These rules shape the very first part of the Works Cited entry. They matter because MLA sorts Works Cited entries alphabetically, and because names are a key way readers track authorship.</p>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>Use full first names whenever you can. For example, write <strong>“Dickinson, Emily”</strong>, not <strong>“Dickinson, E.”</strong> Full names reduce confusion, especially when multiple writers share a last name.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-is-inverted">First author is inverted</h3>
<p>The first author name must be inverted, <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>, so the Works Cited can be alphabetized correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> Frost, Robert  </li>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Robert Frost</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p>If a Poetry Foundation page clearly lists two authors, list both. Invert only the first.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> Smith, Jordan and Taylor Morgan.  </li>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Smith, Jordan, and Morgan, Taylor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">Three or more authors use “et al.” after the first author only</h3>
<p>If there are three or more authors, list only the first author, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the other names.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> Smith, Jordan et al.  </li>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Smith, Jordan, Taylor Morgan, and Casey Lee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p>If no author is credited, start with the page title. For alphabetizing, ignore A, An, and The, but keep the article in the written citation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> “The Negro Speaks of Rivers.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, URL.  </li>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Anonymous. “The Negro Speaks of Rivers.” …</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-and-containers-for-poetry-foundation-pages">
<h2 >Titles and Containers for Poetry Foundation Pages</h2>
<h3 id="title-of-source-usually-in-quotation-marks">Title of source, usually in quotation marks</h3>
<p>For a poem page, the <strong>title of source</strong> is usually the poem title, and it goes in quotation marks:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Road Not Taken.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For an essay or article page, use the article title in quotation marks:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to Read a Poem.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="title-of-container-usually-italicized">Title of container, usually italicized</h3>
<p>The website name is the container. For Poetry Foundation, it is typically:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Poetry Foundation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In MLA, containers are italicized because they are larger wholes that contain the specific item you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-urls-and-access-dates">
<h2 >Dates, URLs, and Access Dates</h2>
<h3 id="publication-date">Publication date</h3>
<p>Use a date if the page provides one. Poetry Foundation poem pages often do not show a clear publication date for the web page itself. If there is no date, you simply skip it. Do not insert n.d.</p>
<p>If a date is present, format it as <strong>Day Month Year</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 Mar. 2022</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>Include the direct URL to the specific page you used. MLA 9 typically omits https://, but your instructor may prefer keeping it. Be consistent.</p>
<h3 id="access-date-practical-for-web-sources">Access date, practical for web sources</h3>
<p>MLA 9 makes access dates optional, but they are often helpful for Poetry Foundation because web pages can be updated. If you include an access date, place it at the end:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-poem-page-with-a-single-author-most-common">
<h2 >Example 1, Poem Page With a Single Author (Most Common)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Frost, Robert. “The Road Not Taken.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> “Frost, Robert.” The first author is inverted, and the first name is written in full.</li>
<li><strong>Title of source:</strong> “The Road Not Taken.” The poem title is in quotation marks because it is a work contained on a web page, not a standalone book in your hands.</li>
<li><strong>Container:</strong> <em>Poetry Foundation</em> is italicized as the website that contains the poem page.</li>
<li><strong>URL:</strong> Points to the exact page, which is essential for a reader to verify the text.</li>
<li><strong>Access date:</strong> Included because the page could be revised or reorganized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Poetry Foundation sometimes provides additional information on the page, such as a poet bio or notes. If you use that material, cite the specific page you used, not just the poem page.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-page-with-no-author-start-with-title">
<h2 >Example 2, Page With No Author (Start With Title)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>“Haiku.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/haiku. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author listed:</strong> You begin with the title of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Title formatting:</strong> “Haiku” is in quotation marks because it is a web page within the site.</li>
<li><strong>Container:</strong> <em>Poetry Foundation</em> is still the container.</li>
<li><strong>No date:</strong> If the page does not provide a publication date, you omit it instead of writing n.d.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not treat Poetry Foundation as the author just because it is the site. In MLA, the website name is usually the container, not the author, unless the page explicitly credits the organization as the author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-two-authors-use-and-second-name-not-inverted">
<h2 >Example 3, Two Authors (Use “and,” Second Name Not Inverted)</h2>
<p>Some Poetry Foundation essays, interviews, or educational pages may credit two contributors. If you encounter a page with two named authors, format it like this.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Smith, Jordan and Taylor Morgan. “Reading Poetry Aloud.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/articles/reading-poetry-aloud. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> Use “and” between names.</li>
<li><strong>Name order:</strong> Only the first author is inverted. The second author remains in normal order.</li>
<li><strong>Everything else:</strong> The page title is in quotation marks, the website is italicized, and the URL and access date help retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the page lists roles, such as “Introduction by” or “Edited by,” MLA can accommodate that, but you should only add roles when they are clearly labeled and relevant. When in doubt, prioritize the author credited at the top of the page.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why These Rules Matter</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Findability:</strong> A correct MLA citation lets a reader locate the exact poem or page quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Accurate author and title information shows careful scholarship.</li>
<li><strong>Fair credit:</strong> Using full names and correct author formatting respects the writer’s identity and avoids confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> MLA style is designed so that citations look similar across many source types, which helps readers scan your Works Cited efficiently.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-and-how-to-avoid-them">
<h2 >Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials instead of full first names:</strong> Write “Langston Hughes,” not “L. Hughes.” If the page only shows an initial, you may not be able to expand it reliably. Use what the source provides, but do not invent names.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting to invert the first author:</strong> The first author must be “Last, First.”</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author in a two author entry:</strong> Only the first author is inverted.</li>
<li><strong>Listing all authors in a three plus author entry:</strong> Use first author plus et al.</li>
<li><strong>Citing the homepage instead of the specific page:</strong> Always cite the URL of the poem or article you used.</li>
<li><strong>Missing quotation marks around the page title:</strong> Poetry titles and article titles on the site should appear in quotation marks in the Works Cited entry.</li>
<li><strong>Adding n.d. for missing dates:</strong> MLA 9 does not require n.d. Skip the date if it is not provided.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-checklist-before-you-submit">
<h2 >Quick Checklist Before You Submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did you use the author’s full first name when available?</li>
<li>Is the first author inverted?</li>
<li>For two authors, did you use “and,” and keep the second name in normal order?</li>
<li>For three or more authors, did you use et al. after the first author only?</li>
<li>If no author is listed, did you start with the page title?</li>
<li>Did you italicize <em>Poetry Foundation</em> and include the specific URL?</li>
<li>Did you include an access date if your instructor expects it, or if the page might change?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you share the exact Poetry Foundation URL you are using, I can format a final MLA 9 Works Cited entry that follows your author rules precisely.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Poetry Foundation citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-poetry-foundation-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes Poetry Foundation citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Poetry Foundation pages often look simple, but they create several MLA 9 edge cases because the site mixes different kinds of content on the same page. A single page might include a poem, a short biography, editor written notes, publication history, audio, and sometimes a translator or an editor credit. MLA 9 asks you to cite what you actually used, and to give readers enough information to find the exact page again. The special cases below focus on places where students often guess, and where guessing leads to inconsistent or misleading Works Cited entries.</p>
<p>Your extra naming rules matter here because Poetry Foundation pages frequently have multiple contributors. If you apply name formatting consistently, your Works Cited becomes easier to scan and more respectful to authors. It also prevents alphabetizing errors.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="decide-what-you-are-citing-poem-page-author-page-or-article">
<h2 >Decide what you are citing: poem page, author page, or article</h2>
<h3 id="poem-page-most-common">Poem page (most common)</h3>
<p>A poem page usually presents the poem as the main work. In MLA, a poem on a website is typically treated as a work in a container. The poem title goes in quotation marks, the website name is italicized, then the publisher and the URL.</p>
<h3 id="author-page-biography-page">Author page (biography page)</h3>
<p>An author page is usually a profile or biography. If there is no listed author for the biography text, MLA has you start with the page title. Many Poetry Foundation biographies do not clearly identify a writer, so “no author” is a common edge case.</p>
<h3 id="article-or-editorial-content">Article or editorial content</h3>
<p>Poetry Foundation also hosts essays, interviews, and features. These often have a byline, and they should be cited like a web article. Do not cite these as poems.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Look for cues near the title, such as “By [name]” or a contributor line. If the page is primarily a poem, cite the poem. If it is primarily an essay about poetry, cite the essay.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-no-author-listed-on-the-page">
<h2 >Special case 1: No author listed on the page</h2>
<p>Poetry Foundation pages often omit an author for biographies, introductions, or general informational pages. In MLA 9, if there is no author, you start the Works Cited entry with the title of the page. Do not invent an author, do not use “Anonymous,” and do not use “n.d.”</p>
<p>Why this rule matters: Starting with the title keeps your Works Cited honest and searchable. It also prevents you from incorrectly attributing editorial writing to the poet.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Using “Poetry Foundation” as the author just because it is the site. In MLA, the site name is usually the container, not the author. Only treat an organization as author if the page clearly credits that organization as the author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-the-poet-is-not-the-author-of-the-page-text-you-used">
<h2 >Special case 2: The poet is not the author of the page text you used</h2>
<p>Sometimes you use Poetry Foundation for a biography, timeline, or commentary about a poet. The poet’s name is prominent, but that does not mean the poet authored the page. If you cite a biography page, the “author” is either the credited writer, or no author, not the poet featured.</p>
<p>Why this rule matters: MLA citations are about accurate attribution. Crediting the poet for an editorial biography misrepresents authorship.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Ask yourself, “Did I quote the poem, or did I quote the biography or commentary?” Cite the specific item you quoted.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-translator-editor-or-selected-by-credits">
<h2 >Special case 3: Translator, editor, or “selected by” credits</h2>
<p>Poetry Foundation sometimes posts translated poems, or poems presented with an editor’s selection note. MLA 9 lets you include contributors when they are important to how you used the source.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you used a translated poem, the translator can be added after the title, usually introduced with “Translated by”.</li>
<li>If the page is clearly an edited presentation and the editor is central to the version you used, you can add “Edited by”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this rule matters: Translations are different works in practice, and readers may need the translator to locate the same text or to understand differences in wording.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Listing the translator as the main author. The poet remains the author of the poem. The translator is a contributor.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-two-authors-or-three-or-more-authors-on-poetry-foundation-content">
<h2 >Special case 4: Two authors, or three or more authors, on Poetry Foundation content</h2>
<p>Some Poetry Foundation essays or learning materials can have multiple authors. Apply your required name rules carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two authors: invert the first author only, then use “and” with the second author in normal order.</li>
<li>Three or more authors: list the first author only, inverted, then add “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this rule matters: Consistent naming prevents confusion and keeps alphabetization correct. It also avoids the common mistake of inverting every author, which MLA does not do.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Using initials. Your rule requires full first names. If the site gives only initials, you should not expand them unless you can verify the full name from a reliable source. If you cannot verify, keep what the source provides, but be consistent across your paper. If your instructor requires full names no matter what, confirm the full name from an authoritative source before expanding it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-missing-date-or-multiple-dates">
<h2 >Special case 5: Missing date, or multiple dates</h2>
<p>Poetry Foundation pages can show:<br />
- A “Published” date for an article.<br />
- An “Updated” date.<br />
- No date at all.</p>
<p>MLA 9 prefers a date if one is available. If there is an updated date, use the date that best matches the version you consulted. If there is no date, you can omit the date. MLA 9 does not require an access date, but it is recommended when a page has no date or when content is likely to change.</p>
<p>Why this rule matters: Dates help readers retrieve the same version, and they help you show that your information was current at the time you used it.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If there is no date, add an access date at the end, for example, “Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-6-urls-stable-links-and-long-tracking-links">
<h2 >Special case 6: URLs, stable links, and long tracking links</h2>
<p>Poetry Foundation URLs are usually stable. MLA 9 recommends including the URL without “https://” if you prefer, but including the full URL is acceptable. The key is clarity and retrievability. Remove tracking parameters if you see a question mark followed by extra characters.</p>
<p>Why this rule matters: Clean URLs reduce broken links and make citations easier to read and type.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: Copying a URL from a share button that adds tracking codes. Use the canonical page URL from the address bar when possible.</p>

<li><strong>Author</strong>: The poet is the author of the poem. The first author name is inverted, and the full first name is used.</li>
<li><strong>Title of source</strong>: The poem title is in quotation marks because it is a short work within a larger container.</li>
<li><strong>Title of container</strong>: <em>Poetry Foundation</em> is italicized as the website name.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: “Poetry Foundation” often functions as the publisher of the site.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: The URL points directly to the poem.</li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong>: Included as a practical choice, especially because some Poetry Foundation pages do not display clear publication dates for poems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common pitfall: Italicizing the poem title. In MLA, the poem title stays in quotation marks.</p>

<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: If the page does not credit a writer, you start with the title.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: The page title is treated as the source title and placed in quotation marks because it is a page within a website.</li>
<li><strong>Container and publisher</strong>: The website and publisher follow.</li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong>: Helpful because biography content can be revised without notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common pitfall: Starting with “Hughes, Langston” just because the page is about him. If you are citing the biography text, and there is no author credited, the poet is not automatically the author of that biography page.</p>

<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: The first author is inverted with a full first name. The second author is in normal order, joined with “and.”</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: The article title is in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: <em>Poetry Foundation</em> is italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: Articles usually have a clear publication date, so include it.</li>

<p>Common pitfalls:<br />
- Inverting both authors. MLA inverts only the first author.<br />
- Replacing “and” with an ampersand. MLA uses “and.”<br />
- Using initials instead of full first names when full names are available.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter in an MLA Works Cited</h2>
<p>MLA 9 is designed to help readers locate your sources quickly and to represent authorship accurately. Poetry Foundation is a common source for poems, but it is also a publisher of editorial content. These edge cases, especially no author pages, translations, and mixed content pages, are where citations most often become inaccurate. When you apply consistent author formatting, correct title formatting, and clear container details, your Works Cited becomes reliable, easy to grade, and genuinely useful to your reader.</p>
<p>If you share a specific Poetry Foundation URL you are using, I can format the exact MLA 9 Works Cited entry and explain which edge case rules apply.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-poem-from-poetry-foundation-in-mla-9">How do I cite a poem from Poetry Foundation in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite a poem on Poetry Foundation in MLA 9, start with the poet’s name, then the poem title in quotation marks, then the website name in italics, the publisher (Poetry Foundation), the date posted (if available), and the URL. End with your access date only if your instructor requires it or if the page is likely to change. Example format, Last Name, First Name. “Poem Title.” Poetry Foundation, Poetry Foundation, Day Month Year, URL. In your Works Cited, use the poem page, not a search results page. In your in-text citation, use the poet’s last name, and line numbers if they are provided on the page, for example, (Bishop lines 3-5). If no line numbers appear, cite the author only, or add a page or section reference only if the page provides stable numbering. For more guidance, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-poems/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-cite-poetry-foundation-as-the-author-or-do-i-cite-the-poet">Do I cite Poetry Foundation as the author, or do I cite the poet?</h3>
<p>Cite the poet as the author when you are using a poem, because the poet wrote the text you are quoting or analyzing. Poetry Foundation is usually the container, meaning the website hosting the content, and it can also appear as the publisher in the Works Cited entry. A practical scenario, if you quote lines from Langston Hughes’s poem on Poetry Foundation, your author will be Hughes, not Poetry Foundation, and your in-text citation will use (Hughes). You cite Poetry Foundation as the author only when the page itself is written by the organization or has no named author, such as an unsigned editorial page, a general “About” page, or some site-produced introductions. If the page lists an individual author for an essay or biography, cite that person instead. For more on authors and containers, see https://style.mla.org/containers/ and https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-poetry-foundation-poet-biography-or-article-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Poetry Foundation poet biography or article in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>For a poet biography or an article on Poetry Foundation, first identify whether an individual author is credited. If an author is listed, begin with that author’s name, then the page title in quotation marks, then the website name in italics, the publisher (Poetry Foundation), the publication date if shown, and the URL. If no author is listed, start with the page title, then continue with the site information. Practical scenario, you use the “Emily Dickinson” biography page to support a claim about her themes. In-text, cite the author if there is one, or use a shortened title in quotation marks if there is not, for example, (“Emily Dickinson”). If you quote the page, include the author or title in the parenthetical citation, not the URL. For MLA’s guidance on web pages and missing elements, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-poetry-foundation-page-does-not-show-a-publication-date-should-i-include-an-access-date">What if the Poetry Foundation page does not show a publication date, should I include an access date?</h3>
<p>If the Poetry Foundation page does not list a publication date, MLA 9 allows you to omit the date and include an access date if your instructor wants one or if you think the content could change. Many instructors prefer an access date for online sources without clear dates. Use the format Accessed Day Month Year. Practical scenario, you cite a poem page that has no “Published” date, or you are citing a biography that may be updated over time. Your Works Cited entry might end with the URL and then “Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.” Do not invent a date from your browsing history. If you can locate a “Published” or “Updated” date on the page, use it instead of an access date, unless your assignment requires both. For more on dates and optional elements, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-poetry-foundation-poems-especially-with-line-numbers">How do I do in-text citations for Poetry Foundation poems, especially with line numbers?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, in-text citations for poems typically use the poet’s last name and line numbers, if line numbering is available in the version you consulted. Practical scenario, you quote lines 10 through 12 from a poem on Poetry Foundation. Your in-text citation should look like (AuthorLastName lines 10-12) or, if your instructor prefers, (AuthorLastName 10-12). If the site does not provide line numbers, cite only the poet’s last name, and make sure your quotation is clear and accurately copied. For longer quotations, format as a block quote per MLA rules, and still include the parenthetical citation at the end. Do not cite the website name in the parenthetical unless there is no author. For detailed rules on quoting and line numbers, see https://style.mla.org/citing-poems/ and https://style.mla.org/mla-formatting-and-style-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-poetry-foundation-if-i-found-the-poem-through-google-or-a-link-in-another-article">How do I cite Poetry Foundation if I found the poem through Google or a link in another article?</h3>
<p>Cite the source you actually used for the text, which is usually the Poetry Foundation page where you read the poem or article. You should not cite Google search results, and you usually do not cite the page that merely linked you there, unless you are also discussing that linking page. Practical scenario, a blog post links to a Poetry Foundation poem, and you quote the poem itself. Your Works Cited entry should be for the poem page on Poetry Foundation, with the poet as author, not the blog and not the search engine. Another scenario, you are analyzing how the blog frames the poem. Then you may cite both, the blog for its commentary, and Poetry Foundation for the poem text. This approach matches MLA’s principle of citing the work you consulted. For more help, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
