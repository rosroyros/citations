<section class="content-section" id="what-mla-poem-citations-do-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >What MLA poem citations do and why they matter</h2>
<p>In MLA 9th edition, a poem citation tells your reader exactly where a poem came from so they can find the same text you used. Poems appear in many places, such as a single-author poetry book, an anthology, a textbook, a website, or a database. Each location changes what information you need to include.</p>
<p>Getting the format right matters for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Credibility</strong>: Accurate citations show you worked with reliable sources and handled them carefully.  </li>
<li><strong>Traceability</strong>: A reader should be able to locate the poem quickly, even if it exists in multiple versions.  </li>
<li><strong>Fair credit</strong>: Poetry is often republished, excerpted, and edited. Clear citations give proper credit to the poet and to the container that published the poem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your rules about author names also matter because names control how entries alphabetize in Works Cited. Inconsistent or shortened names can make sources hard to find and can create confusion when multiple authors share a last name.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-pattern-for-poems-works-cited">
<h2 >Core MLA pattern for poems (Works Cited)</h2>
<p>Most MLA citations follow this basic structure:</p>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Poem." Title of Container, edited by Editor (if any), Publisher, Year, page range.</strong></p>
<p>The “container” is where the poem appears. A container could be a book, an anthology, a website, or a database. MLA focuses on helping readers locate the exact version you used, so the container details are important.</p>
<h3 id="author-rules-you-must-follow-based-on-your-requirements">Author rules you must follow (based on your requirements)</h3>
<p>Use these author rules for poem citations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One author</strong>: Invert the name and use the full first name.  </li>
<li>Format: <strong>Last, First Middle.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: First author inverted, second author in normal order, use <strong>and</strong>.  </li>
<li>Format: <strong>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: First author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong>  </li>
<li>Format: <strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: Start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”  </li>
<li>Format: <strong>"Title of Poem." Title of Container, ...</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules matter because the Works Cited list is alphabetized. Inverting only the first author keeps the list consistent and searchable.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-and-formatting-rules-for-poems">
<h2 >Titles and formatting rules for poems</h2>
<h3 id="poem-title">Poem title</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the <strong>poem title in quotation marks</strong> because a poem is usually a short work.<br />
  Example: <strong>"The Red Wheelbarrow."</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="book-or-website-title-container-title">Book or website title (container title)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the <strong>container title in italics</strong>.<br />
  Example: <em>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</em> or <em>Poetry Foundation</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-numbers">Page numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the poem is in print, include the <strong>page range</strong>.<br />
  Example: <strong>pp. 112 to 113.</strong>  </li>
<li>If you are quoting from a poem, you will usually cite <strong>line numbers</strong> in the in-text citation, not in the Works Cited entry.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="in-text-citations-for-poems-lines-matter">
<h2 >In-text citations for poems (lines matter)</h2>
<p>Poems are often cited by <strong>line numbers</strong> because page numbers can vary by edition. If line numbers are provided in the source, use them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One line</strong>: (LastName line)<br />
  Example: (Frost 14)</li>
<li><strong>A range of lines</strong>: (LastName lines 14-18)<br />
  Example: (Frost lines 14-18)</li>
</ul>
<p>If line numbers are not provided, use page numbers instead, if available. If neither is available, cite what you can, such as the author name alone, but only if it still clearly points to the source.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-format-is-correct">Why this format is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: “Angelou, Maya” is inverted and uses the poet’s full first name.  </li>
<li><strong>Poem title</strong>: In quotation marks because it is a short work inside a larger book.  </li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: <em>And Still I Rise</em> is italicized because it is the book title.  </li>
<li><strong>Publisher and year</strong>: Included to identify the exact edition.  </li>
<li><strong>Page range</strong>: Helps readers locate the poem in the print book.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-examples">In-text citation examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quoting one line: (Angelou 7) if line numbers are given in the book.  </li>
<li>If only pages are available: (Angelou 42).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the book includes line numbers only in the margins for some poems, cite the line numbers when possible. If the poem has no line numbers, do not invent them.</p>

<p>Dickinson, Emily. "Because I Could Not Stop for Death." <em>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</em>, edited by Robert S. Levine, W. W. Norton and Company, 2017, pp. 1234-1235.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-format-is-correct">Why this format is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: “Dickinson, Emily” is inverted and uses the full first name.  </li>
<li><strong>Poem title</strong>: In quotation marks.  </li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: The anthology title is italicized.  </li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>: Anthologies usually have an editor, so “edited by” is included.  </li>
<li><strong>Publisher and year</strong>: Identify the exact anthology edition, which matters because page numbers and poem selections can change.  </li>
<li><strong>Page range</strong>: Required for a poem found in a printed anthology.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-examples">In-text citation examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>With line numbers: (Dickinson lines 1-4)  </li>
<li>With page numbers only: (Dickinson 1234)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Students often cite the editor as the author of the poem. In MLA, the <strong>poet is the author</strong>, and the editor belongs in the container information.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-3-poem-on-a-website-no-page-numbers">
<h2 >Example 3, Poem on a website (no page numbers)</h2>

<p>Frost, Robert. "The Road Not Taken." <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, Poetry Foundation, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-format-is-correct">Why this format is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: Full first name used, first author inverted.  </li>
<li><strong>Poem title</strong>: Quotation marks.  </li>
<li><strong>Website name</strong>: <em>Poetry Foundation</em> is the container and is italicized.  </li>
<li><strong>Publisher or site sponsor</strong>: “Poetry Foundation” is listed as the publisher because it is the organization responsible for the site.  </li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: Included so the reader can locate the poem.  </li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong>: Helpful for web sources because pages can change or be updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-examples">In-text citation examples</h3>
<p>Web versions may not provide stable line numbering. If the page shows line breaks but no line numbers, you have two options:<br />
- <strong>Use the author name only</strong> if it remains clear: (Frost).<br />
- <strong>Use line numbers only if the site provides them</strong>. Do not count lines yourself unless your instructor specifically allows it.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the website provides a publication date for the page, include it in the Works Cited entry. If it does not, MLA allows you to omit the date rather than writing “n.d.”</p>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Poem Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-and-edge-cases-when-citing-poems-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Special cases and edge cases when citing poems in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing poems in MLA 9 is usually straightforward, but poems often appear in places that create “edge cases,” such as anthologies, websites with changing URLs, scanned PDFs, social media posts, or recordings of readings. The key is to keep MLA’s core goal in mind: help readers find the exact poem you used, in the exact version you used, with enough detail to locate it again.</p>
<p>Your author name rules matter here because poems are frequently republished and reprinted. Using full first names and consistent name order makes your Works Cited list easier to scan, reduces confusion between authors with similar last names, and improves accuracy in databases and library catalogs.</p>
<p>Below are the most common special cases, with practical tips and common pitfalls.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="1-poem-in-a-collection-by-the-same-poet-a-whole-book-of-poems">
<h2 >1) Poem in a collection by the same poet (a whole book of poems)</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>Students sometimes cite only the book and forget to identify the specific poem. MLA expects you to cite the poem as a part of the book, not just the book, because the poem is the item you used.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the poem title in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Put the book title in italics.</li>
<li>Include publisher and year.</li>
<li>Add page numbers if the book has them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you quote lines, include line numbers in your in-text citations if they are provided. If not, use page numbers, or use a shortened title and line numbers only if you can count lines reliably from the version you used.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="2-poem-in-an-anthology-or-textbook-edited-by-someone-else">
<h2 >2) Poem in an anthology or textbook edited by someone else</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>Anthologies have editors, editions, and sometimes multiple publishers. The poem is still the “work,” but the container is the anthology. You should name the editor because it helps readers identify the exact anthology.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the poet.</li>
<li>Add the poem title.</li>
<li>Add the anthology title.</li>
<li>Add the editor with “edited by.”</li>
<li>Add edition information if relevant, then publisher, year, and page range.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not list the editor as the author of the poem. The poet is the author of the poem. The editor belongs in the container details.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="3-poem-accessed-on-a-website-including-poetry-archives-and-magazines">
<h2 >3) Poem accessed on a website (including poetry archives and magazines)</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>Web versions may not have page numbers, may omit line numbering, may change URLs, and may show a “last updated” date instead of a publication date. Some sites also present poems as images or in interactive formats.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cite the poem title in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Cite the website name in italics.</li>
<li>Include the publisher or sponsoring organization if it is listed.</li>
<li>Include a publication date if available.</li>
<li>Include the URL.</li>
<li>Include an access date if the page is likely to change, or if no publication date is given.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the poem is on a site that changes frequently, an access date is helpful. It tells your reader when you saw that version.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using “n.d.” when no date is provided. MLA prefers you omit the date if it is not available.</li>
<li>Linking to a search results page instead of the poem’s stable page.</li>
<li>Treating the website as the author when a poet is clearly credited.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="4-poem-with-no-listed-author">
<h2 >4) Poem with no listed author</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>This happens with traditional ballads, nursery rhymes, folk songs, and anonymous poems posted online without attribution. Sometimes the author is truly unknown, sometimes the site simply failed to credit the poet.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the title of the poem.</li>
<li>Do not write “Anonymous.”</li>
<li>Use the same formatting rules, quotation marks for a poem, italics for a whole book.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the poem is traditionally anonymous but commonly attributed in scholarship, you can mention attribution in your discussion, but your citation should reflect what the source states. If the source gives no author, begin with the title.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="5-poem-translated-into-english">
<h2 >5) Poem translated into English</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>You may be using the poem, the translation, or both. The translator is essential because different translations can read very differently.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>List the original poet as the author.</li>
<li>Add the poem title as it appears in your source.</li>
<li>Include “translated by” and the translator’s full name.</li>
<li>Cite the container where you found it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>

<h2 >6) Poem with two authors, or three or more authors</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>Collaborative poems, co-written spoken word pieces, or works credited to multiple writers require careful author formatting.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-based-on-your-rules">What to do, based on your rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two authors: invert the first author only, then use “and” plus the second author in normal order.</li>
<li>Three or more authors: list the first author inverted, then add “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Be consistent with full first names. If a source only provides initials, look for an “About” page, a contributor bio, a library record, or the title page of the book to confirm the full name.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="7-poem-quoted-or-reprinted-inside-another-source-a-poem-inside-a-novel-essay-or-article">
<h2 >7) Poem quoted or reprinted inside another source (a poem inside a novel, essay, or article)</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>Sometimes you did not consult the poem’s original publication, you saw it quoted in someone else’s work. MLA calls this an indirect source situation.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, find and cite the poem in its original container.</li>
<li>If you cannot, cite the source where you found the poem, and make clear in your prose that you are using it as quoted there.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Indirect citations are acceptable, but they are weaker evidence. Use them when necessary, not by default.</p>

<h2 >8) Poem in audio or video form (a recorded reading)</h2>
<h3 id="what-makes-it-an-edge-case">What makes it an edge case</h3>
<p>You are not reading the poem on a page, you are hearing or watching a performance. This matters because performances can differ from printed texts.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cite the performer, often the poet, as the author if they are the primary creator.</li>
<li>Use the poem title if it is given, or the video title if the poem title is not clear.</li>
<li>Include the platform, the date, and the URL.</li>

<h2 >Example 1, Poem in an anthology (edited container)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Angelou, Maya. “Still I Rise.” <em>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</em>, edited by Robert S. Levine, 10th ed., W. W. Norton and Company, 2022, pp. 1965-67.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The poet is the author, so the entry begins with <strong>Angelou, Maya</strong> in inverted order.<br />
- The poem is a short work, so the title is in quotation marks.<br />
- The anthology is the container, so it is italicized and includes the editor, edition, publisher, year, and page range.<br />
- Page numbers help readers locate the poem quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Listing the editor first. Editors do not replace the poet as author.<br />
- Omitting the poem title and citing only the anthology.</p>

<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Dickinson, Emily. “Because I Could Not Stop for Death.” <em>Poetry Foundation</em>, Poetry Foundation, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47652/because-i-could-not-stop-for-death-479. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The poet is credited, so the citation starts with <strong>Dickinson, Emily</strong>.<br />
- The poem title is in quotation marks.<br />
- The site name is italicized as the container.<br />
- A URL is included so readers can find the exact page.<br />
- The access date is useful because web content can change, and some pages do not clearly display stable publication dates.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip for in-text citations</strong><br />
If the website displays line numbers, use them. If not, cite the poet’s last name and a shortened title in your prose, then quote carefully. Avoid inventing line numbers unless the lines are clearly countable and stable in that version.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- Two authors are listed.<br />
- The first author is inverted, <strong>Smith, Patricia</strong>.<br />
- The second author is not inverted, <strong>Tracy K. Smith</strong>, and “and” connects them.<br />
- The poem title is in quotation marks.<br />
- The journal is italicized and includes volume, issue, year, and pages.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Inverting both names. Only the first author is inverted in MLA Works Cited entries.<br />
- Using initials instead of full first names.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="accuracy-and-traceability">
<h2 >Accuracy and traceability</h2>
<p>Poems often exist in many versions, such as revised editions, classroom anthologies, online archives, and recordings. Small citation details, like editor names, edition numbers, and page ranges, help your reader find the exact text you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="fair-credit">
<h2 >Fair credit</h2>
<p>Full first names and correct author formatting reduce ambiguity and give clear credit. This is especially important when multiple poets share a last name, or when a poet is known by a pseudonym.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="professional-consistency">
<h2 >Professional consistency</h2>
<p>A Works Cited page is easier to read when every entry follows the same structure. Consistency also helps instructors verify sources and helps you avoid accidental plagiarism.</p>

<h2 >Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prefer stable sources, such as books, library databases, or reputable poetry archives.</li>
<li>Record the version details immediately, such as edition, editor, page numbers, and URL.</li>
<li>Use line numbers in in-text citations when the source provides them.</li>
<li>If you use a scanned PDF of a book, cite it like a book, then add the database or website as an additional container if applicable.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="pitfalls">
<h2 >Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Citing only the website home page, not the poem’s page.</li>
<li>Using “n.d.” for missing dates, omit the date instead.</li>
<li>Confusing the editor with the author.</li>
<li>Inventing line numbers from a webpage that reflows on different screens.</li>
<li>Listing more than one author when there are three or more, your rule requires first author plus “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If you tell me what kind of poem source you are using, printed book, anthology, database PDF, website, or video performance, I can format a Works Cited entry and an in-text citation that matches your exact case.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-poem-in-mla-9-in-my-works-cited-list">How do I cite a poem in MLA 9 in my Works Cited list?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, start with the poet’s last name, then first name. Put the poem title in quotation marks, then the title of the book or website in italics, followed by the editor or translator if relevant, the publisher, the year, and the page range if the poem is in a print collection. End with the medium details only when needed, such as a URL and access date for some web sources. Example for a book: Frost, Robert. “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” The Poetry of Robert Frost, edited by Edward Connery Lathem, Henry Holt, 1969, pp. 224-25. Example for a website: Angelou, Maya. “Still I Rise.” Poetry Foundation, Poetry Foundation, www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46446/still-i-rise. For full templates and punctuation rules, see MLA Works Cited guidance at https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-quote-lines-from-a-poem-in-mla-and-when-do-i-use-slashes-or-block-quotes">How do I quote lines from a poem in MLA, and when do I use slashes or block quotes?</h3>
<p>For short quotations of poetry that fit within your sentence, use quotation marks and separate line breaks with a space, a forward slash, and another space. Keep the original capitalization and punctuation. After the quote, include an in-text citation with the line numbers, not page numbers, when line numbers are available. Example: (Frost lines 13-16). If you quote three lines or fewer, you usually keep it in your text with slashes. If you quote more than three lines of poetry, format it as a block quotation. Start the block on a new line, indent the entire quote, and do not use quotation marks. Put the parenthetical citation after the final punctuation. MLA’s quoting guidance is here: https://style.mla.org/formatting-quotations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-an-in-text-citation-for-a-poem-with-line-numbers-and-what-if-there-are-no-line-numbers">How do I do an in-text citation for a poem with line numbers, and what if there are no line numbers?</h3>
<p>If the poem has line numbers, MLA prefers line numbers in the in-text citation. Use the poet’s last name in the signal phrase or in parentheses, then list the line number or range. Examples: “…” (Brooks line 8) or “…” (Brooks lines 8-12). If you mention the poet in your sentence, you can cite only the line numbers, for example, (lines 8-12), as long as it is clear which source you mean. If the poem has no line numbers, use page numbers if available, for example, (Bishop 34). If neither line nor page numbers exist, cite the poet’s name alone and keep the quotation short, or cite a division like a stanza number if the source labels them. More on MLA in-text citations: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-poem-i-found-online-in-mla-9-including-urls-and-access-dates">How do I cite a poem I found online in MLA 9, including URLs and access dates?</h3>
<p>For an online poem, cite the poet, the poem title in quotation marks, the website name in italics, the publisher or sponsoring organization if it differs from the site name, the publication date if listed, and the URL. MLA allows you to omit “https://” in many cases, but consistency matters. Include an access date if the page is likely to change, if there is no publication date, or if your instructor requires it. Practical scenario: you quote lines from a poem on Poetry Foundation, then your Works Cited entry should point readers to the exact page you used. Example: Rich, Adrienne. “Diving into the Wreck.” Poetry Foundation, www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47932/diving-into-the-wreck. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025. For MLA web citation details, see https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-poem-that-is-reprinted-in-an-anthology-or-a-textbook-in-mla">How do I cite a poem that is reprinted in an anthology or a textbook in MLA?</h3>
<p>When a poem appears in an anthology or textbook, you cite the poem first, then the container, which is the book that reprints it. Start with the poet, then the poem title in quotation marks. Next list the anthology title in italics, the editor(s) if named, the edition if relevant, the publisher, the year, and the page range of the poem. Practical scenario: you use a Norton anthology in class, and you quote a stanza from a poem. Your Works Cited entry should help a reader find the poem inside that anthology, so page numbers are essential. Example structure: Poet. “Poem Title.” Anthology Title, edited by Editor Name, Publisher, Year, pp. xx-xx. If the anthology is accessed in a database, add the database as a second container and include a stable URL or DOI. MLA container guidance: https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-translated-poem-in-mla-9-and-do-i-cite-the-translator-or-the-poet">How do I cite a translated poem in MLA 9, and do I cite the translator or the poet?</h3>
<p>Cite the original poet as the author, then give the poem title. After the title, identify the translator in the entry, usually with “Translated by.” If you are analyzing the translation choices, the translator becomes especially important, but the poet remains the main author in most MLA citations. Practical scenario: you quote a translated haiku from a bilingual collection. Your Works Cited entry should include both the poet and the translator, plus the book details and page numbers. Example structure: Neruda, Pablo. “Poem Title.” Translated by Translator Name, Book Title, Publisher, Year, pp. xx-xx. In your in-text citation, use the poet’s name and line numbers if provided in the translation, or page numbers if not. For MLA guidance on contributors like translators, see https://style.mla.org/contributors/.</p>
