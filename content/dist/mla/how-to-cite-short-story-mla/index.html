<section class="content-section" id="what-counts-as-a-short-story-in-mla-works-cited">
<h2 >What counts as a short story in MLA Works Cited</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a short story is usually treated as a work inside a larger container. The container is most often a book (an anthology, a collection, or a textbook) or a website. Your citation should make it easy for a reader to locate the exact story you used, not just the larger source that contains it.</p>
<p>A short story citation typically answers these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who wrote the story?</li>
<li>What is the title of the story?</li>
<li>Where did you find it (book, anthology, database, website)?</li>
<li>Who edited the container (if applicable)?</li>
<li>Who published it, and when?</li>
<li>What pages or URL lead to the story?</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA works best when you think in “pieces,” then assemble them in the correct order.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-format-for-a-short-story-most-common-case-story-in-a-book">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 format for a short story (most common case: story in a book)</h2>
<p>Use this structure when the short story appears in a printed book or an ebook that has stable page numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited format</strong><br />
- <strong>Author Last, First Middle.</strong> “<strong>Title of Short Story.</strong>” <em>Title of Container (Book or Anthology)</em>, edited by Editor First Last, Publisher, Year, pp. page range.</p>
<p><strong>Why the punctuation and formatting matter</strong><br />
- The author name is first so your Works Cited list can be alphabetized by author.<br />
- The short story title is in quotation marks because it is a shorter work within a larger work.<br />
- The container title is italicized because it is the full book.<br />
- The page range matters because it tells the reader exactly where the story appears.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules you must follow (and why they matter)</h2>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Author names must use full first names, not initials.<br />
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Full names reduce confusion, especially when multiple writers share the same last name or initials. It also improves clarity and respects author identity.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-inverted">First author inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> The first author is always inverted, <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>.<br />
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> Inversion is what makes alphabetizing consistent in the Works Cited list.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Use <strong>and</strong> between names, the second author is not inverted.<br />
<strong>Format:</strong> Last, First Middle, and First Last.<br />
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA uses “and” for readability. Keeping only the first author inverted preserves alphabetical sorting while still presenting both names clearly.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Use the first author only, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the other authors.<br />
<strong>Format:</strong> Last, First Middle, et al.<br />
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> This keeps citations clean and consistent while still giving clear credit.</p>
<h3 id="no-author">No author</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”<br />
<strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA prioritizes what your reader can actually verify. If no author is listed, the title is the most reliable starting point.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-short-story-in-an-anthology-one-author">
<h2 >Example 1: Short story in an anthology (one author)</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You read a short story in a printed anthology edited by someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct MLA formatting)</strong><br />
Jackson, Shirley. “The Lottery.” <em>The Norton Introduction to Literature</em>, edited by Kelly J. Mays, W. W. Norton and Company, 2016, pp. 335 to 343.</p>
<p><strong>What each part is doing</strong><br />
- <strong>Jackson, Shirley.</strong> This is the author, inverted for alphabetizing.<br />
- <strong>“The Lottery.”</strong> Quotation marks show it is a short work inside a larger work.<br />
- <strong>The Norton Introduction to Literature</strong> This is the container, italicized.<br />
- <strong>edited by Kelly J. Mays,</strong> Editors are included because the editor helped shape and organize the anthology.<br />
- <strong>W. W. Norton and Company, 2016,</strong> Publisher and year help identify the exact edition.<br />
- <strong>pp. 335 to 343.</strong> Page range tells readers where the story appears.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> Use the page numbers from the edition you actually used. Different editions often have different page ranges.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-short-story-with-two-authors-coauthored-story-in-a-collection">
<h2 >Example 2: Short story with two authors (coauthored story in a collection)</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> The short story has two authors and appears in a collection.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
King, Stephen, and Peter Straub. “The Talisman: Excerpt.” <em>Collaborative Horror Stories</em>, edited by Maria Lopez, Beacon Press, 2020, pp. 41 to 58.</p>
<p><strong>Why this follows your rules</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, <strong>King, Stephen</strong>.<br />
- The second author is normal order, <strong>Peter Straub</strong>.<br />
- “and” connects the two authors.<br />
- The short story title is in quotation marks.<br />
- The book title is italicized.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Do not invert the second author. Writing “King, Stephen, and Straub, Peter” breaks MLA’s two author pattern and makes the citation harder to scan.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-short-story-on-a-website-no-page-numbers">
<h2 >Example 3: Short story on a website (no page numbers)</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You read a short story on a website. There is no listed author.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
“Cathedral.” <em>Classic Short Stories Online</em>, 2023, www.classicshortstoriesonline.example/cathedral. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>What to notice</strong><br />
- No author, so the entry starts with the title in quotation marks.<br />
- The website name is the container and is italicized.<br />
- A URL is included because there are no page numbers.<br />
- “Accessed” is useful when web content can change or move.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the website provides a publication date, use it. If it does not, MLA often allows you to omit the date rather than invent one. Your rule says do not use “n.d.”, so simply leave the date out and include an access date if needed.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="how-in-text-citations-work-for-short-stories">
<h2 >How in-text citations work for short stories</h2>
<p>In-text citations connect your writing to the Works Cited entry. They usually include the author’s last name and a page number.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-story-is-in-a-book-with-page-numbers">If the story is in a book with page numbers</h3>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> (LastName page)<br />
Example: (Jackson 339)</p>
<h3 id="if-there-is-no-author">If there is no author</h3>
<p>Use a shortened title in quotation marks.<br />
Example: (“Cathedral”)</p>
<h3 id="if-you-cite-the-story-title-in-your-sentence">If you cite the story title in your sentence</h3>
<p>You can sometimes omit it from the parentheses and keep only the page number, but only if the author is already clear in the sentence.<br />
Example: Jackson describes the crowd’s mood shifting quickly (339).</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-real-academic-writing">
<h2 >Why these rules matter in real academic writing</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency helps readers.</strong> When every citation follows the same pattern, readers can locate sources quickly.</li>
<li><strong>It supports credibility.</strong> Accurate citations show that your evidence is traceable.</li>
<li><strong>It prevents accidental plagiarism.</strong> Clear sourcing distinguishes your ideas from the author’s words and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>It improves grading outcomes.</strong> Many instructors grade MLA formatting directly, especially in composition and literature courses.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials instead of full first names.</strong> Your rule requires full first names, so write “Shirley Jackson,” not “S. Jackson.”</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting quotation marks around the short story title.</strong> Short works get quotation marks, containers get italics.</li>
<li><strong>Italics on the wrong element.</strong> Do not italicize the short story title. Italicize the anthology, book, or website name.</li>
<li><strong>Listing all authors when there are three or more.</strong> Use the first author plus <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mixing editions.</strong> Page numbers and editors must match the exact edition you used.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving out the container.</strong> A short story citation is often incomplete without the anthology title or website name.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="quick-checklist-you-can-use-before-turning-in-your-works-cited">
<h2 >Quick checklist you can use before turning in your Works Cited</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did you invert the first author’s name as Last, First Middle?</li>
<li>Did you use full first names, not initials?</li>
<li>Did you put the short story title in quotation marks?</li>
<li>Did you italicize the container title?</li>
<li>Did you include editor information when relevant?</li>
<li>Did you include page range for print sources or a URL for web sources?</li>
<li>Did your in-text citations match the first element of the Works Cited entry?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell me where your short story came from, for example an anthology, a single author collection, a database like JSTOR, or a website, I can format a Works Cited entry using your exact source details.</p>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Short Story Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-and-edge-cases-when-citing-a-short-story-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Special cases and edge cases when citing a short story in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing short stories in MLA 9 is usually straightforward, you cite the story as a work within a larger container, such as an anthology, a textbook, a journal, or a website. Edge cases happen when details are missing, when the story appears in more than one place, when the version matters, or when the “author” is not a single person. The goal of MLA is consistency and traceability, so a reader can find the exact short story you used.</p>
<p>Below are the most common special cases, what to do, and why it matters.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-idea-to-remember">
<h2 >Core idea to remember</h2>
<p>A short story is often part of something bigger. In MLA terms, the story is the “work,” and the book, website, or database is the “container.” That is why many short story citations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author of the short story  </li>
<li>Title of the short story in quotation marks  </li>
<li>Title of the container in italics  </li>
<li>Editor or translator if relevant  </li>
<li>Version or edition if relevant  </li>
<li>Publisher, date  </li>
<li>Page range for print, or URL for online  </li>
</ul>
<p>When you handle edge cases, you still follow this same order. You just choose the best available information.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-name-rules-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author name rules, and why they matter</h2>
<p>Your rules change how the author element is written, and this affects every special case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use full first names, not initials. This avoids confusion between people with similar initials and respects author identity.</li>
<li>Invert the first author only, Last, First Middle.</li>
<li>For two authors, use “and,” and do not invert the second author.</li>
<li>For three or more authors, list only the first author followed by “et al.”</li>
<li>If there is no author, start with the title of the short story.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules matter because the first element controls alphabetizing in Works Cited, and because the author line is the most common place where citations become inconsistent.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-1-the-short-story-is-in-an-anthology-with-an-editor">
<h2 >Edge case 1, the short story is in an anthology with an editor</h2>
<p>This is the most common scenario, and it becomes an edge case when students forget to include the editor, or they accidentally treat the editor as the author.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Author and story title come first.</li>
<li>Then the anthology title in italics.</li>
<li>Then the editor, introduced with “edited by.”</li>
<li>Then publisher, year, and page range.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Anthologies often contain many authors. The editor helps identify the exact book you used, especially when the anthology title exists in multiple editions.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-short-story-in-a-print-anthology-with-explanation">Example 1, short story in a print anthology (with explanation)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Jackson, Shirley. “The Lottery.” <em>The Norton Introduction to Literature</em>, edited by Kelly J. Mays, W. W. Norton and Company, 2016, pp. 335 to 342.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this formatting is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Jackson, Shirley</strong> is inverted because it is the first element and must alphabetize correctly.<br />
- <strong>“The Lottery.”</strong> is in quotation marks because it is a short work inside a larger container.<br />
- <strong>The Norton Introduction to Literature</strong> is italicized because it is the container.<br />
- <strong>edited by Kelly J. Mays</strong> is included because the editor is responsible for the container.<br />
- <strong>pp. 335 to 342</strong> gives the exact location in the print book.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Putting the editor first, which incorrectly suggests the editor wrote the story.<br />
- Italicizing the story title, which is reserved for the container, not the short work.<br />
- Leaving out page numbers for print sources.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-2-the-short-story-is-reprinted-and-you-used-a-specific-version">
<h2 >Edge case 2, the short story is reprinted, and you used a specific version</h2>
<p>Sometimes a short story appears in many places, for example, a magazine publication, a later anthology reprint, and an online archive. If you used a specific version, cite the version you actually consulted.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cite the container you used, not the “original” container you did not read.</li>
<li>If the story has a translator, credit the translator.</li>
<li>If the anthology is a special edition, include the edition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Different versions can have different introductions, page numbering, editorial notes, or even textual changes. Your citation should match what your reader could access if they follow your Works Cited.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you mention an “original publication” date in your writing, you can include it in your sentence, but your Works Cited entry should still reflect the source you used.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-3-two-authors-three-authors-or-group-authorship">
<h2 >Edge case 3, two authors, three authors, or group authorship</h2>
<p>Short stories are usually single author works, but collaborative fiction exists, and some stories are credited to organizations or collectives.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>Follow your rule, invert the first author only, use “and,” and keep the second author in normal order.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>List the first author only, then add “et al.” Do not list the remaining authors.</p>
<h3 id="group-author">Group author</h3>
<p>If an organization is the author, use the organization name as written. If there is no person listed, do not invent one.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-4-no-author-listed">
<h2 >Edge case 4, no author listed</h2>
<p>This happens with some websites, classroom handouts, or databases that present the story without a clear author line.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the short story title in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Then list the container, and the rest of the details you have.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>MLA does not want you to guess. Starting with the title is honest and still lets readers locate the work.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-no-author-listed-on-a-website-with-explanation">Example 2, no author listed on a website (with explanation)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“The Yellow Wallpaper.” <em>American Literature Online</em>, American Literature Online, 2024, www.example.org/yellow-wallpaper. Accessed 10 Dec. 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this formatting is correct</strong><br />
- The entry starts with <strong>“The Yellow Wallpaper.”</strong> because no author is provided.<br />
- The container <strong>American Literature Online</strong> is italicized.<br />
- The website name appears as the publisher element here because it is presented as the site’s responsible organization.<br />
- A URL is included because it is an online source.<br />
- An access date is included, which is useful when web content can change.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Writing “Anonymous” or “n.d.” which your rules forbid and which MLA does not require.<br />
- Omitting the container title, which makes it harder to identify where the story appears online.<br />
- Forgetting the access date when the page has no clear publication date or may change.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-5-a-short-story-from-a-database-like-jstor-or-a-library-platform">
<h2 >Edge case 5, a short story from a database, like JSTOR or a library platform</h2>
<p>Many students cite the database as if it is the publisher, or they skip the original journal or anthology information. MLA treats databases as a second container.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cite the story as it appears in the journal, magazine, or book first.</li>
<li>Then add the database name as a second container, italicized.</li>
<li>Add the stable URL or DOI if available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>The journal or book is the true publication context, and the database is the access platform. Including both helps readers locate the story even if they use a different access route.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Prefer a DOI when available. If there is no DOI, use a stable URL provided by the database.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-6-a-short-story-in-a-course-pack-pdf-or-learning-management-system">
<h2 >Edge case 6, a short story in a course pack, PDF, or learning management system</h2>
<p>Sometimes you read a scanned PDF that has incomplete information.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the information visible on the PDF, such as anthology title, editor, page numbers, or original publication details.</li>
<li>If the PDF is posted in a course system, you can treat the course site as the container only if it is the only identifying container you have.</li>
<li>Avoid guessing. If you cannot find the publisher, leave it out rather than inventing it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Course materials are often temporary. The best citation gives enough information for a reader to identify the original source, not just the classroom copy.</p>

<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Lahiri, Jhumpa and Hanya Yanagihara. “Two Writers, One Story.” <em>Literary Collaborations Quarterly</em>, vol. 12, no. 2, 2022, www.lcqjournal.org/two-writers-one-story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this formatting is correct</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, <strong>Lahiri, Jhumpa</strong>, and the second author is not inverted, <strong>Hanya Yanagihara</strong>, following your rule for two authors.<br />
- The short story title is in quotation marks.<br />
- The journal title is italicized as the container.<br />
- Volume and issue are included because they help locate the story within the journal.<br />
- A URL is included because it is online.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Inverting the second author, which breaks MLA formatting.<br />
- Using initials, which your rules prohibit.<br />
- Leaving out volume and issue when they are available.</p>

<h2 >Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always ask, “What container did I actually use,” then cite that container.</li>
<li>Copy names exactly as shown, but convert them to your required format, full first names, and correct inversion for the first author.</li>
<li>For print, include page ranges. For online, include a DOI or URL.</li>
<li>If something is missing, omit it, do not guess. MLA prefers accurate incomplete information over invented details.</li>
<li>Use consistent punctuation, periods after major elements, commas within elements like publisher and date.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Treating an editor as the author of the short story.</li>
<li>Italicizing the short story title instead of putting it in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Listing all authors when there are three or more, instead of using “et al.”</li>
<li>Using “Anonymous” or “n.d.” when the author or date is missing.</li>
<li>Citing a story you found in a database as if the database is the original publisher, rather than a second container.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-academic-writing">
<h2 >Why these rules matter in academic writing</h2>
<p>These special case rules matter because readers must be able to retrace your research. Short stories often exist in multiple editions, collections, and online reproductions. Precise author formatting supports correct alphabetization and avoids identity confusion. Clear container information shows exactly where you accessed the text. When you handle edge cases carefully, your Works Cited becomes a reliable map, not just a formality.</p>
<p>If you want, share the details of your short story source, where you found it, print or online, and what information is missing, and I can format the exact MLA 9 Works Cited entry using your author rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-short-story-in-mla-when-it-is-in-a-book-anthology">How do I cite a short story in MLA when it is in a book anthology?</h3>
<p>To cite a short story from an anthology in MLA 9, start with the author of the short story, then put the story title in quotation marks. After that, give the anthology title in italics, followed by the editor (if listed), the publisher, the year, and the page range of the story. Example: Oates, Joyce Carol. "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" The Oxford Book of American Short Stories, edited by Joyce Carol Oates, Oxford UP, 2013, pp. 401-414. In your in-text citation, use the author’s last name and the page number, like (Oates 405). If the anthology has multiple editors or a translator, include those roles as MLA specifies. For more detail, see the MLA Works Cited guide: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and the MLA in-text citations guide: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations-the-basics/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-short-story-i-found-online-in-mla-and-what-if-there-are-no-page-numbers">How do I cite a short story I found online in MLA, and what if there are no page numbers?</h3>
<p>For an online short story, cite the author, the story title in quotation marks, the website name in italics, the publisher or sponsor (if different from the site name), the publication date, the URL, and the access date if it helps readers locate a changing source. If there are no page numbers, do not invent them. Use a paragraph number if the site provides them, or cite by author alone if no stable locator exists. Example Works Cited: Jackson, Shirley. "The Lottery." The New Yorker, 26 June 1948, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/06/26/the-lottery. In text: (Jackson) or (Jackson, par. 12) if paragraphs are numbered. If you are quoting, consider adding a short signal phrase to point readers to the passage. For more, see MLA on URLs and access dates: https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-short-story-from-a-database-like-jstor-gale-or-ebsco-in-mla">How do I cite a short story from a database like JSTOR, Gale, or EBSCO in MLA?</h3>
<p>When a short story is accessed through a library database, MLA recommends citing the original container (the book, journal, or magazine) and then the database as a second container. Start with the story author and title in quotation marks, then the original source title in italics, any editors, volume or issue if applicable, publisher, date, and page range. After that, add the database name in italics, and a DOI or stable URL. Example: Lahiri, Jhumpa. "A Temporary Matter." The New Yorker, 8 Jan. 1999, pp. 40-51. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/xxxxx. In text, cite (Lahiri 45). If the database provides a permalink, prefer it over a long session URL. For MLA container rules, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-short-story-in-an-mla-in-text-citation-if-i-mention-the-author-in-my-sentence">How do I cite a short story in an MLA in-text citation if I mention the author in my sentence?</h3>
<p>If you name the author in your sentence, MLA in-text citation usually includes only the page number in parentheses, because the author is already clear. For example: Hemingway suggests the tension grows through silence (12). If you do not mention the author in the sentence, include the author’s last name and the page number, like (Hemingway 12). If the short story is online with no page numbers, you can use (Hemingway) or a paragraph number if available. If you cite two different stories by the same author, include a shortened title in quotation marks to avoid confusion, like (Hemingway, "Hills" 12). This is common when writing about multiple works in one paper. For more examples, see MLA in-text guidance: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations-the-basics/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-short-story-with-two-authors-or-an-author-with-a-pen-name-in-mla">How do I cite a short story with two authors, or an author with a pen name, in MLA?</h3>
<p>For a short story with two authors, list both in the Works Cited entry in the order shown in the source. The first author is Last Name, First Name, and the second author is First Name Last Name. Example: Garcia, Maria, and Thomas Lee. "Title of Story." Title of Anthology, edited by ..., Publisher, Year, pp. xx-xx. In text, cite both last names, like (Garcia and Lee 27). For three or more authors, use the first author’s last name followed by et al. If the author uses a pen name, cite the name that appears on the work as the author. If you know the legal name, do not add it unless the source itself provides it as part of the author information. For author formatting details, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-short-story-i-read-in-a-textbook-or-course-packet-and-what-if-the-packet-has-no-clear-publisher">How do I cite a short story I read in a textbook or course packet, and what if the packet has no clear publisher?</h3>
<p>If the short story appears in a textbook, treat it like an anthology: cite the story author and title, then the textbook title in italics, the editor or author of the textbook if relevant, the edition, publisher, year, and page range. A course packet can be trickier. If it is a compiled set of readings with a title and a compiler or instructor listed, cite the short story first, then the packet as the container. If key publication details are missing, include what you can, such as the course packet title, the institution, the instructor or department as compiler, and the year, plus page numbers from the packet. In text, cite the story author and the packet page number, like (Chopin 6). For handling missing information, see MLA guidance on optional elements: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
