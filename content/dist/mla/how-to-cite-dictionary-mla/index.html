<section class="content-section" id="what-an-mla-dictionary-citation-does">
<h2 >What an MLA dictionary citation does</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a dictionary citation tells readers exactly where you found a definition or entry so they can locate it again. Dictionaries can be tricky because entries often have no listed author, entries can change over time (especially online), and the “title” can refer to both the entry and the dictionary itself. MLA solves this by focusing on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry title (the word you looked up).</li>
<li>The dictionary or reference work that contains it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because dictionary definitions can be updated, MLA also often needs an access date for online dictionaries, especially when no clear publication date is provided.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-9-format-for-a-dictionary-entry">
<h2 >The basic MLA 9 format for a dictionary entry</h2>
<h3 id="print-dictionary-entry-most-common-pattern">Print dictionary entry (most common pattern)</h3>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“Entry Title.” <em>Dictionary Title</em>, edited by Editor Full Name, Publisher, Year, page number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What each part means</strong><br />
- <strong>“Entry Title.”</strong> This is the specific word or phrase you looked up. Put it in quotation marks because it is a short work inside a larger work.<br />
- <strong>*Dictionary Title*</strong> Italicize the dictionary title because it is a complete work.<br />
- <strong>edited by…</strong> Include editors if they are listed and relevant on the title page.<br />
- <strong>Publisher, Year</strong> Use the publisher and publication year of that edition.<br />
- <strong>page number</strong> Include the page where the entry appears.</p>
<h3 id="online-dictionary-entry-most-common-pattern">Online dictionary entry (most common pattern)</h3>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“Entry Title.” <em>Dictionary Title</em>, Publisher (if listed), Day Month Year (if listed), URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
- Many online dictionaries do not clearly list a publication date for each entry. If there is no date, you can omit it and include an <strong>Accessed</strong> date.<br />
- If the dictionary has a stable “last updated” date for the entry, include it. If it does not, the access date becomes more important.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-and-how-they-apply-to-dictionary-entries">
<h2 >Author rules, and how they apply to dictionary entries</h2>
<p>Your rules about authors are important, but dictionary entries frequently have <strong>no author</strong>. That is normal. Here is how your author rules connect to dictionary citations:</p>
<h3 id="if-an-entry-has-an-author-less-common-but-possible">If an entry has an author (less common, but possible)</h3>
<p>Use the author as the first element.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One author:</strong> Invert the name.</li>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> First author inverted, second author normal order, use <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle and First Last.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors:</strong> First author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="if-there-is-no-author-very-common">If there is no author (very common)</h3>
<p>Start with the <strong>entry title</strong>, not the dictionary title.</p>
<p>This matters because MLA wants the Works Cited list to be easy to scan and alphabetize. Starting with the entry title also helps readers immediately see what word you defined.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-online-dictionary-entry-with-no-author-typical">
<h2 >Example 1, Online dictionary entry with no author (typical)</h2>

<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“Metaphor.” <em>Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary</em>, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metaphor. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author is listed</strong>, so the citation begins with the entry title: <strong>“Metaphor.”</strong></li>
<li>The container is the dictionary site: <em>Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary</em>.</li>
<li>The publisher is included because Merriam-Webster clearly identifies it.</li>
<li>An <strong>Accessed</strong> date is included because online dictionary entries can be updated, and readers may see a slightly different version later.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If your instructor prefers you to omit the publisher when it matches the site title, MLA allows flexibility. However, including it is often helpful and is commonly accepted.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not italicize the entry title. Only the dictionary title is italicized.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li>The entry title, “Oxymoron,” is a short piece inside a larger reference work, so it goes in quotation marks.</li>
<li>The dictionary title is italicized because it is the full book.</li>
<li>Editors are included because major reference works often emphasize editorial responsibility, and MLA treats editors as important contributors.</li>
<li>The page number is included because print sources require a location marker.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the dictionary uses volume numbers, add the volume before the page number if it helps readers locate the entry:<br />
- Example pattern: <strong>vol. 2, p. 1023.</strong></p>

<p>Do not list the city of publication. MLA 9 generally does not require it.</p>

<h2 >Example 3, Online dictionary entry with an individual author (less common)</h2>
<p>Some specialized dictionaries, encyclopedias, or reference databases credit an author for each entry. If an entry has an author, you should use your author rules and place the author first.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-one-author">Works Cited entry (one author)</h3>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li>The entry has a credited author, so the citation starts with the author.</li>
<li>The author name uses <strong>full first name</strong>, and the first author is inverted: <strong>Garcia, Elena Maria.</strong></li>
<li>The entry title is in quotation marks.</li>
<li>The dictionary or reference site is italicized.</li>
<li>A publication date is included because it is provided.</li>
<li>The access date is still useful for online reference content, especially if updates are possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not put the author after the title. In MLA, the author goes first when available.</p>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Dictionary Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-dictionary-citations-special-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes dictionary citations “special” in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Dictionary entries look simple, but they create frequent edge cases because you are often citing a small part of a larger reference work. MLA 9 treats the dictionary as a container, and the entry as the specific item you used. The tricky parts usually involve authorship (often missing), versions (print versus online), and how to handle stable identifiers like entry IDs, DOIs, or permalinks.</p>
<p>In MLA 9, your goal is to help readers find the exact entry you used, in the exact version you consulted. That is why details like the entry title, edition, publisher, URL, and access date sometimes matter more than they do for a book or article.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-pattern-for-a-dictionary-entry-what-you-build-from">
<h2 >Core pattern for a dictionary entry (what you build from)</h2>
<p>A typical Works Cited entry for a dictionary entry is built like this:</p>
<p><strong>Entry Title.</strong> <em>Dictionary Title</em>, edited by Editor Name(s), edition (if given), Publisher, Year. URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<p>Not every element appears every time. MLA is flexible, but it is not random. You include what helps identification and retrieval.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-and-edge-cases-you-will-see-often">
<h2 >Special cases and edge cases you will see often</h2>
<h3 id="1-no-author-for-the-entry-most-common">1) No author for the entry (most common)</h3>
<p>Many dictionary entries do not name an author. In MLA 9, if there is no author, you start with the <strong>title of the entry</strong> in quotation marks. This is a key edge case because students often start with the dictionary title instead, which makes it harder to locate the entry quickly in an alphabetical Works Cited list.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element. If you begin with the dictionary title when there is no author, your entry is filed under the dictionary, not under the word you actually looked up. Starting with the entry title makes your Works Cited easier to scan and matches how readers search.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Put the entry title in quotation marks. Italicize the dictionary title.</p>
<h3 id="2-when-the-entry-has-an-author-less-common-but-important">2) When the entry has an author (less common, but important)</h3>
<p>Some specialized dictionaries and encyclopedic dictionaries credit individual entries. If the entry has an author, that author becomes the first element.</p>
<p>Apply your rules carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the author’s full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>Invert the first author’s name, Last, First Middle.</li>
<li>For two authors, use “and,” and do not invert the second author.</li>
<li>For three or more authors, list the first author (inverted) followed by “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> You are crediting the person responsible for the entry’s content, not just the dictionary as a whole. This improves accuracy and avoids misattributing scholarship to an editor or institution.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing editors as authors. Editors belong after the dictionary title, introduced by “edited by,” unless the dictionary explicitly presents them as the author of the entry itself.</p>
<h3 id="3-corporate-authorship-rare-for-entries-common-for-whole-dictionaries">3) Corporate authorship (rare for entries, common for whole dictionaries)</h3>
<p>Sometimes a dictionary is presented as created by an organization, and the entry still has no individual author. You usually still begin with the entry title, not the organization, because the entry itself is the item you used.</p>
<p>Use the organization as the author only if it is clearly the author of the entry or the whole work is being cited rather than a specific entry.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are citing the dictionary as a whole (for example, discussing the dictionary’s methodology), then the organization can lead. If you are citing a single definition, lead with the entry title.</p>
<h3 id="4-print-dictionary-entries-page-numbers-edition-details">4) Print dictionary entries (page numbers, edition details)</h3>
<p>Print dictionaries often require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edition number (if not the first).</li>
<li>Page number(s) for the entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA 9 does not require a city of publication. Also, do not force “n.d.” if you cannot find a date. For print dictionaries, the year is usually present. If it is missing, omit it.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Print sources are located by edition and page. Without those, a reader may not find the same entry, especially if definitions change across editions.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using a URL for a print dictionary because you found the citation online. Cite the format you actually used.</p>
<h3 id="5-online-dictionary-entries-urls-permalinks-and-access-dates">5) Online dictionary entries (URLs, permalinks, and access dates)</h3>
<p>Online entries change. Many dictionaries update definitions without changing the visible date. For online dictionary entries, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL (prefer a permalink or stable URL if available).</li>
<li>An access date when the content is likely to change or when no clear publication date is provided.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The access date tells readers when you saw that version. This is especially important for evolving entries, new words, and usage notes that may be revised.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the site provides a “Cite” tool, use it as a starting point only. Then correct capitalization, italics, quotation marks, and name formatting to match MLA 9.</p>
<h3 id="6-updated-dates-revision-dates-and-missing-dates">6) “Updated” dates, revision dates, and missing dates</h3>
<p>Online dictionaries may show “Last updated” dates, a year, or no date at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a date is shown for the entry, include it.</li>
<li>If no date is shown, omit the date and include an access date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid “n.d.” MLA 9 does not require it.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using the copyright year from the website footer as the entry date. That footer year usually applies to the site as a whole, not the specific entry.</p>
<h3 id="7-multiple-definitions-sense-numbers-and-quoting-part-of-an-entry">7) Multiple definitions, sense numbers, and quoting part of an entry</h3>
<p>Sometimes you need to cite a specific numbered sense, like definition 2a, or a usage note.</p>
<p>MLA 9 does not require you to specify “sense 2a” in the Works Cited entry, but you can clarify in your in-text citation or in your prose. If the dictionary provides a stable entry section link or anchor, you can use it, but it is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you quote a specific sense, make sure your quoted wording matches that sense exactly. If you paraphrase, still cite the entry.</p>
<h3 id="8-entry-ids-dois-or-database-style-records">8) Entry IDs, DOIs, or database-style records</h3>
<p>Some academic dictionaries are hosted on platforms that provide entry IDs, DOIs, or database record numbers. If a DOI is available, include it. If not, use a stable URL. If both exist, MLA generally prefers the DOI because it is designed to be persistent.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Academic reference works can move between platforms. A DOI or stable identifier keeps your citation findable.</p>
<h3 id="9-alphabetization-edge-case-titles-beginning-with-articles">9) Alphabetization edge case, titles beginning with articles</h3>
<p>If your Works Cited entry begins with the entry title and the entry title begins with “A,” “An,” or “The,” ignore that article for alphabetization, but keep it in the citation.</p>
<p>This is mostly relevant when the entry itself is a phrase like “The Hague.”</p>

<h2 >Examples with correct MLA 9 formatting and explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-online-dictionary-entry-with-no-author-and-no-clear-date">Example 1, Online dictionary entry with no author and no clear date</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited:</strong></p>
<p>“Climate anxiety.” <em>Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary</em>, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/climate%20anxiety. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- No author is listed for the entry, so the entry title comes first in quotation marks.<br />
- The dictionary title is italicized because it is the container.<br />
- The publisher is included as Merriam-Webster.<br />
- There is no specific publication date for the entry, so the access date is included to show when you consulted it.<br />
- The URL points directly to the entry, which helps readers locate it quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Starting with <em>Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary</em> instead of the entry title. That would bury the citation under “M” rather than under “C.”</p>
<h3 id="example-2-print-dictionary-entry-with-edition-and-page-number">Example 2, Print dictionary entry with edition and page number</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited:</strong></p>
<p>“Diaspora.” <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</em>, 5th ed., Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, p. 509.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- The entry has no author, so it begins with the entry title in quotation marks.<br />
- The dictionary title is italicized.<br />
- The edition is included because print dictionaries often have multiple editions with different wording.<br />
- The publisher and year are included.<br />
- The page number is included because that is how a reader finds the entry in print.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the entry spans more than one page, use “pp.” and the page range.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-entry-with-a-credited-author-showing-name-rules">Example 3, Entry with a credited author (showing name rules)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited:</strong></p>
<p>Smith, Jordan Lee. “Code-switching.” <em>Dictionary of Sociolinguistics</em>, edited by Maria Elena Torres and David Andrew Nguyen, 2nd ed., Academic Press, 2023, pp. 112-13.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- The entry has an author, so the citation begins with the author’s name.<br />
- The author’s name is inverted, Smith, Jordan Lee, and uses a full first name, not initials.<br />
- The entry title is in quotation marks.<br />
- The dictionary title is italicized.<br />
- Editors follow the dictionary title and are introduced with “edited by.”<br />
- The edition is included, then publisher, year, and page range.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Inverting the second editor’s name in the “edited by” field. In MLA, editor names after “edited by” are typically written in normal order unless they are placed in the author position. Also, do not replace full first names with initials.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls checklist</h2>
<h3 id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cite the entry, not just the dictionary, unless your discussion is about the dictionary as a whole.</li>
<li>Prefer permalinks, stable URLs, or DOIs when available.</li>
<li>Use access dates for online entries that change or that lack a clear publication date.</li>
<li>Keep formatting consistent, entry title in quotation marks, dictionary title in italics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Treating editors as authors when the entry has no author.</li>
<li>Using initials instead of full first names when an author is credited.</li>
<li>Omitting edition and page number for print dictionaries.</li>
<li>Using a website footer year as the entry’s publication date.</li>
<li>Alphabetizing under the dictionary title when the entry has no author.</li>

<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>Dictionary citations are often used to support precise claims about meaning, usage, or connotation. Small differences in wording can change an argument. MLA 9’s approach, citing the entry as the item and the dictionary as the container, helps your reader locate the exact definition you used and evaluate your evidence. Clear authorship rules also ensure that credit goes to the correct contributor when entries are signed, and that your Works Cited list remains easy to navigate.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-dictionary-definition-in-mla-9-for-a-paper">How do I cite a dictionary definition in MLA 9 for a paper?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, a dictionary entry is usually cited like a work in a reference book. In your Works Cited, start with the entry word in quotation marks, then the dictionary title in italics, the edition if given, the publisher, the year (or the most recent update date for online entries), and the URL if you used a website. Add an access date only if your instructor requires it or the content is likely to change. Example scenario, you define “hegemony” using an online dictionary entry. Your in text citation typically uses the entry word, for example: (“Hegemony”). If you name the dictionary in the sentence, you can omit it from parentheses. For official guidance and examples, see MLA Dictionary Entries: https://style.mla.org/citing-dictionary-entries/ and the MLA Works Cited basics: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-online-dictionary-entry-in-mla-and-do-i-need-a-url-and-access-date">How do I cite an online dictionary entry in MLA, and do I need a URL and access date?</h3>
<p>For an online dictionary entry, include the URL in the Works Cited because it helps readers locate the exact page. MLA generally does not require an access date, but it is recommended when the entry is likely to change over time or when no publication or update date is provided. Practical scenario, you cite a Merriam Webster entry that shows no clear date, or you suspect the definition could be revised. In that case, add “Accessed Day Month Year” at the end. Your citation will usually look like: “Entry Word.” Dictionary Title, Publisher (if listed), Date, URL. Accessed Date. In text, cite the entry word in quotation marks, for example: (“Semantic”). For more detail on URLs, access dates, and online containers, see https://style.mla.org/urls/ and https://style.mla.org/access-dates/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-do-i-put-in-the-in-text-citation-for-a-dictionary-definition-and-do-i-use-page-numbers">What do I put in the in-text citation for a dictionary definition, and do I use page numbers?</h3>
<p>In text citations for dictionary entries usually do not use page numbers unless you consulted a print dictionary and you are quoting from a specific page that is stable and useful for readers. More often, you cite the entry word in quotation marks, for example: (“Diaspora”). If you are citing multiple definitions or a specific numbered sense, you can clarify in your sentence, for example, “I use sense 2 of the Oxford English Dictionary definition of ‘diaspora’.” If you use a print dictionary and page numbers are available, you may include them, but MLA style often works well without them because entries are organized alphabetically. Practical scenario, you quote a short definition from a print dictionary for a timed in class essay. You can cite (“Diaspora” 412) if your instructor expects page numbers. See MLA in text citation guidance: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-the-oxford-english-dictionary-oed-in-mla-when-it-lists-editors-and-has-frequent-updates">How do I cite the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in MLA when it lists editors and has frequent updates?</h3>
<p>For the OED, treat the entry as a work in an online reference source. In Works Cited, begin with the entry word in quotation marks, then Oxford English Dictionary in italics, the publisher (Oxford University Press), the date of the entry or last update if provided, and the URL. Because OED entries are updated, an access date can be helpful, especially if you are relying on a specific wording or historical note. Practical scenario, you cite the etymology section and a definition that might change. Add an access date to document what you saw. In text, cite the entry word, for example: (“Sustainability”). If you cite multiple OED entries, keep your Works Cited entries distinct by using the different headwords. For MLA’s dictionary entry guidance, see https://style.mla.org/citing-dictionary-entries/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-dictionary-entry-with-no-author-and-what-if-the-entry-word-is-the-same-as-my-paper-title">How do I cite a dictionary entry with no author, and what if the entry word is the same as my paper title?</h3>
<p>Most dictionary entries do not have an author, so MLA style starts the Works Cited entry with the headword, which is the term being defined. Put the headword in quotation marks, then list the dictionary title in italics and the rest of the publication details. In text, you also cite the headword, for example: (“Metaphor”). Practical scenario, your essay is titled “Metaphor in Political Speech,” and you also cite the dictionary entry “metaphor.” That is fine, because the in text citation points to the Works Cited entry, not to your title. If you cite two different dictionaries for the same headword, distinguish them in your Works Cited by listing each dictionary separately. In text, you can name the dictionary in the sentence to make it clear which one you mean. More help: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-specialized-dictionary-or-glossary-entry-like-a-medical-or-legal-dictionary-in-mla">How do I cite a specialized dictionary or glossary entry, like a medical or legal dictionary, in MLA?</h3>
<p>Specialized dictionaries and glossaries are cited similarly to general dictionaries, but you should include details that help readers identify the source type and version. In Works Cited, start with the entry term in quotation marks, then the specialized dictionary title in italics, edition or version if listed, publisher, date, and the URL for online sources. Practical scenario, you define “proximate cause” using an online legal dictionary for a criminal justice paper. Your Works Cited might include the version number and an access date if the site updates frequently. In text, cite the entry term, for example: (“Proximate Cause”). If the glossary is part of a larger website or database, treat it as a container and include the site name and URL. For MLA container and reference work guidance, see https://style.mla.org/containers/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-dictionary-entries/.</p>
