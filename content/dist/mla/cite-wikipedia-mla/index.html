<section class="content-section" id="what-an-mla-9-wikipedia-citation-is-trying-to-do">
<h2 >What an MLA 9 Wikipedia citation is trying to do</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a Works Cited entry is meant to help a reader quickly answer three questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What exactly did you use.</li>
<li>Who is responsible for it.</li>
<li>Where can someone else find the same version you used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wikipedia is a special case because it is constantly revised. Two people can open the same article on different days and see different wording, different sources, and different facts. That is why MLA citations for Wikipedia should point to a stable version of the page and should include an access date, so your reader knows when you viewed it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-9-format-for-a-wikipedia-article">
<h2 >The basic MLA 9 format for a Wikipedia article</h2>
<p>Most Wikipedia entries have no named author. In MLA 9, when there is no author, you start with the title of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited format (most common, no author listed):</strong></p>
<p><em>“Title of Article.”</em> <em>Wikipedia</em>, Wikimedia Foundation, Day Month Year of last update, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<h3 id="what-each-part-means">What each part means</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Title of Article.”</strong><br />
  Use quotation marks because the Wikipedia article is a page within a larger website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wikipedia</strong><br />
  Italicize the site name because it functions like a container for the article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wikimedia Foundation</strong><br />
  This is the publisher. In many MLA citations you might omit a publisher when it is the same as the website name, but Wikipedia is commonly cited with the publisher included, and many instructors expect it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Day Month Year of last update</strong><br />
  Wikipedia shows a “last edited” date. MLA prefers the version date because it helps identify which content you used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL</strong><br />
  Use the full URL. MLA 9 allows URLs without “https://,” but including it is acceptable. Do not underline it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessed Day Month Year</strong><br />
  This matters for Wikipedia more than many other sites because the content changes frequently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="how-your-author-rules-apply-to-wikipedia">
<h2 >How your author rules apply to Wikipedia</h2>
<p>Your rules about authors are correct for MLA 9 generally, but most Wikipedia articles do not list a single author in a way that fits MLA’s author element. Wikipedia articles are written by many contributors, and the page typically does not present a standard author line.</p>
<p>Here is how to apply your author rules in practice.</p>
<h3 id="if-there-is-no-author-most-wikipedia-pages">If there is no author (most Wikipedia pages)</h3>
<p>Start with the title. Do not write “Anonymous.” Do not use “n.d.” If there is no author, the title becomes the first element.</p>
<h3 id="if-an-author-is-clearly-named-rare-on-wikipedia-more-common-on-other-wikis">If an author is clearly named (rare on Wikipedia, more common on other wikis)</h3>
<p>Only use an author if the page clearly credits one person or a small set of people as authors in a standard way. If that happens, follow your rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One author:</strong> Last, First Middle.  </li>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> First author inverted, and second author normal order with “and.”  </li>
<li><strong>Three or more:</strong> First author inverted, then “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<p>In normal Wikipedia articles, you will almost always use the no author format.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-find-the-same-version-you-used">They help readers find the same version you used</h3>
<p>Because Wikipedia changes, citing only the article title and website can send your reader to a different version than the one you consulted. Including a date of last update and your access date reduces confusion.</p>
<h3 id="they-support-academic-honesty-and-checking">They support academic honesty and checking</h3>
<p>A good citation lets a reader verify your claim. If your reader cannot locate the content you referenced, your credibility suffers, even if you were correct at the time you wrote.</p>
<h3 id="they-keep-your-works-cited-consistent-and-easy-to-scan">They keep your Works Cited consistent and easy to scan</h3>
<p>MLA’s order and punctuation create a predictable pattern. That predictability helps readers locate titles, dates, and URLs quickly, especially when your Works Cited list is long.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-a-typical-wikipedia-article-with-no-author-works-cited">
<h2 >Example 1, a typical Wikipedia article with no author (Works Cited)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>“Photosynthesis.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, Wikimedia Foundation, 18 Dec. 2025, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-formatted-this-way">Why it is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author appears,</strong> so the entry begins with the article title in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Wikipedia is the container,</strong> so it is italicized.</li>
<li><strong>The date “18 Dec. 2025”</strong> represents the last edit date shown on the page. MLA uses day month abbreviated year.</li>
<li><strong>Access date is included</strong> because Wikipedia changes and you want to show when you viewed it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-for-this-example">In-text citation for this example</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations usually use the first element of the Works Cited entry. Since there is no author, use a shortened title in quotation marks.</p>
<p>(“Photosynthesis”)</p>
<p>If you mention the title in your sentence, you may not need a parenthetical citation.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-citing-a-specific-revision-using-permanent-link-best-practice">
<h2 >Example 2, citing a specific revision using “Permanent link” (best practice)</h2>
<p>When accuracy matters, it is often better to cite a stable revision, not the live page. Wikipedia provides a “Permanent link” in the sidebar or in the page history. That link includes an “oldid” number, which points to one specific version.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (stable revision):</strong></p>
<p>“Renaissance.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, Wikimedia Foundation, 9 Nov. 2025, en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renaissance&amp;oldid=1184321000. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-stronger-than-a-normal-url">Why this is stronger than a normal URL</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>oldid link</strong> will not change, even if the current page is edited later.</li>
<li>Your reader can see exactly what you saw, which is especially useful if you quote Wikipedia or rely on a specific definition.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation">In-text citation</h3>
<p>(“Renaissance”)</p>
<p>If you cite multiple Wikipedia pages with similar titles, shorten carefully so each in-text citation clearly matches a single Works Cited entry.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-a-wikipedia-page-that-credits-a-named-author-uncommon-showing-your-author-rules">
<h2 >Example 3, a Wikipedia page that credits a named author (uncommon), showing your author rules</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates your rules, even though it is unusual for standard Wikipedia articles. Use this only if the page itself clearly lists credited authors in a way that matches MLA’s author element.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (two authors):</strong></p>
<p>Nguyen, Alicia Marie, and Jordan Lee. “Example Article Title.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, Wikimedia Foundation, 2 Oct. 2025, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example_Article_Title. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="what-this-example-demonstrates">What this example demonstrates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full first names are used,</strong> not initials.</li>
<li><strong>First author is inverted,</strong> Nguyen, Alicia Marie.</li>
<li><strong>Second author is not inverted,</strong> and is connected with <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li>The rest follows the standard Wikipedia pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there were three or more credited authors, you would list only the first author in inverted form, then add <strong>et al.</strong> For example, “Nguyen, Alicia Marie, et al.”</p>

<h3 id="use-the-pages-last-edited-date-not-the-date-you-started-reading">Use the page’s last edited date, not the date you started reading</h3>
<p>MLA wants the version date when available. Wikipedia provides it, so use it.</p>
<h3 id="prefer-a-permanent-link-when-you-quote-or-rely-on-exact-wording">Prefer a permanent link when you quote or rely on exact wording</h3>
<p>If you quote Wikipedia, a stable revision is the safest choice. Otherwise, your quote may not match the page later.</p>
<h3 id="keep-titles-exactly-as-they-appear">Keep titles exactly as they appear</h3>
<p>Preserve capitalization and spelling. Do not italicize the article title. Put it in quotation marks.</p>
<h3 id="use-the-shortest-clean-url-that-still-works">Use the shortest clean URL that still works</h3>
<p>If you use the normal page URL, use the standard article link. If you use a permanent link, keep the oldid URL intact.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaving out the access date.</strong> This is a frequent mistake, and it matters more for Wikipedia than many websites.</li>
<li><strong>Treating Wikipedia as the author.</strong> Wikipedia is the website title, not the author of the specific content.</li>
<li><strong>Using “n.d.” for missing dates.</strong> Wikipedia nearly always has a last edited date. If a date truly is not available, you can omit it, but do not insert “n.d.” under your rules.</li>
<li><strong>Listing “Wikipedia contributors” as an author.</strong> This is sometimes suggested in older guidance, but MLA 9 generally works better with the no author format that starts with the article title.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting quotation marks around the article title.</strong> The article is a page, so it should be in quotation marks, not italics.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Wikipedia citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-wikipedia-needs-special-handling-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Why Wikipedia needs special handling in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Wikipedia is unusual because it is a living, collaboratively edited reference work. That creates edge cases that do not come up as often with books, journal articles, or static web pages. In MLA 9, the goal is to help readers find exactly what you used. With Wikipedia, that usually means you must be extra careful about versioning, dates, and URLs, because the page can change after you consult it.</p>
<p>Wikipedia citations matter for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verifiability</strong>. Your reader should be able to see the same wording, data, or claim you saw.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>. Wikipedia is often a starting point, not an endpoint. A clear citation lets readers evaluate how current the page was and whether it is appropriate for your project.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-approach-for-wikipedia-entries">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 approach for Wikipedia entries</h2>
<p>In most student papers, a Wikipedia entry is treated like an entry in an online reference work. In MLA 9, a typical Works Cited entry includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title of the entry</strong> in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Title of the website</strong> in italics, usually <em>Wikipedia</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>, which is often omitted for Wikipedia because the site effectively publishes itself, and MLA commonly treats it as not necessary here.</li>
<li><strong>Date of last modification</strong>, if you use the stable version information.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>, ideally a stable URL.</li>
<li><strong>Accessed date</strong>, recommended when the content is likely to change, which is true for Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="special-note-on-authorship-rules-and-wikipedia">Special note on authorship rules and Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Wikipedia entries usually do not have a single author listed in a way that fits MLA author formatting. In most cases, treat Wikipedia as <strong>no author</strong> and start with the <strong>title of the entry</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are citing a Wikipedia page that clearly lists a named author in a way that is credible and stable, which is rare for standard Wikipedia articles, follow your author rules. Use full first names, invert the first author, and apply two author and three author rules. Most of the time, though, Wikipedia will be a <strong>no author</strong> case.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-1-citing-the-version-you-used-not-just-the-page">
<h2 >Edge case 1, Citing the version you used, not just the page</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>A Wikipedia page can be edited minutes after you read it. If you cite only the main page URL, your reader might see a different version.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>Use Wikipedia’s <strong>Permanent link</strong> feature, which locks your citation to the specific revision you used.</p>
<p>How to find it:<br />
- On Wikipedia, click <strong>View history</strong>.<br />
- Find the revision you used, then click the date and time of that revision.<br />
- Use the resulting URL, or use <strong>Permanent link</strong> in the sidebar if available.</p>
<p>If you use a permanent link, you can often include the revision date and time that Wikipedia provides. This strengthens your citation because it points to a fixed version.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-2-no-clear-publication-date-or-conflicting-dates">
<h2 >Edge case 2, No clear publication date, or conflicting dates</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>Wikipedia pages show several date signals, and they can conflict:<br />
- A page may not clearly show a “published” date.<br />
- The “last edited” date changes frequently.<br />
- Your browser may show a retrieved date.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>If you use a permanent link, use the <strong>revision date and time</strong> shown on that revision page. If you cite the general article page, include an <strong>Accessed</strong> date, because the content can change.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If your instructor expects a date, the revision date from the permanent link is the most defensible “version date” for Wikipedia.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-3-citing-a-section-table-or-list-within-a-wikipedia-article">
<h2 >Edge case 3, Citing a section, table, or list within a Wikipedia article</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>Sometimes you use only a specific part of a long Wikipedia entry, such as a table of population data, a filmography list, or a section like “Early life.”</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, you can specify the part you used in your <strong>in-text citation</strong> or in your prose. Wikipedia pages do not have stable page numbers, so you typically cite the title and then direct the reader by naming the section.</p>
<p>Practical tip: Use the section heading in your sentence, for example, “In the ‘Reception’ section of the Wikipedia entry…”. Then cite the entry title in parentheses.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-4-when-the-entry-title-begins-with-a-an-or-the">
<h2 >Edge case 4, When the entry title begins with A, An, or The</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>MLA alphabetizes Works Cited entries by the first main word of the entry. If the title begins with A, An, or The, you ignore those words for alphabetization.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>Still write the title normally in the citation, but alphabetize as MLA requires.</p>
<p>Example: “The Beatles” is alphabetized under B, not T.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-5-wikipedia-pages-with-unusual-titles-punctuation-or-non-english-titles">
<h2 >Edge case 5, Wikipedia pages with unusual titles, punctuation, or non-English titles</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>Some titles include parentheses, special characters, or foreign language titles. These can be easy to mistype, and a small change can make the source hard to find.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>Copy the title exactly as it appears on the page, including parentheses. Keep the capitalization as Wikipedia displays it, since MLA generally preserves the source’s title styling.</p>
<p>If you use a non-English Wikipedia page, cite it as you would any other web page, but keep the title and site name as they appear. Consider adding an English translation of the title in brackets in your writing if your reader needs it, but do not usually alter the Works Cited title.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="edge-case-6-citing-wikipedias-talk-pages-revision-history-or-editors">
<h2 >Edge case 6, Citing Wikipedia’s Talk pages, revision history, or editors</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>Sometimes a project requires you to discuss how knowledge is produced on Wikipedia, or you need to cite a dispute on a Talk page. These pages are not standard encyclopedia entries.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>Treat them as web pages within the Wikipedia site. Start with the page title, then <em>Wikipedia</em>, then the date if listed, then the URL, then Accessed.</p>
<p>Authorship is still usually not a single named author. For Talk pages, usernames may appear, but they are not typically treated as standard authors in MLA Works Cited entries unless your instructor explicitly wants attribution to specific users.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-1-standard-wikipedia-article-with-no-author-using-a-permanent-link">
<h2 >Example 1, Standard Wikipedia article with no author, using a permanent link</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“Marie Curie.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, Wikimedia Foundation, 15 Oct. 2025, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Curie&amp;oldid=1180000000. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>No author</strong>: Wikipedia entries usually do not have a single author, so the citation starts with the <strong>title</strong>.<br />
- <strong>Title in quotation marks</strong>: The entry is a page within a larger reference site.<br />
- <strong>Site name in italics</strong>: <em>Wikipedia</em> is the container.<br />
- <strong>Permanent link</strong>: The <code>oldid</code> URL points to a specific revision, which is crucial for a source that changes.<br />
- <strong>Accessed date</strong>: Even with a permanent link, an accessed date can help document when you consulted the material.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Using only <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie</code> can lead readers to a different version than the one you used.</p>

<p>“The Beatles.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>No author</strong>: Start with the title.<br />
- <strong>No date listed</strong>: If you are not using a permanent link, you might not have a stable revision date to cite. MLA allows you to omit the date.<br />
- <strong>Accessed date is important</strong>: It signals the version timeframe and helps readers understand that the page may have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Adding “n.d.” for “no date.” MLA does not require “n.d.” here, and your rules explicitly say not to use it.</p>

<h2 >Example 3, Citing a Talk page as a special Wikipedia source</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“Talk: Climate Change.” <em>Wikipedia</em>, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Climate_change. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- This is not an encyclopedia entry, it is a discussion page. The formatting still follows MLA’s web page pattern.<br />
- The title reflects the exact page name, including “Talk:”.<br />
- Authorship is not treated as a standard named author, so the entry begins with the title.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Trying to list multiple usernames as authors. That can become messy and does not match how Wikipedia presents responsibility for the page as a whole.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prefer permanent links</strong> for anything you quote, paraphrase closely, or use for specific data.</li>
<li><strong>Use Accessed dates</strong> consistently for Wikipedia, because it is designed to change.</li>
<li><strong>Double-check the title</strong> and the URL. Small errors can break the link.</li>
<li><strong>Consider citing Wikipedia’s sources instead</strong> when possible. If Wikipedia points you to a book, a journal article, or a reputable report, citing that source often strengthens your paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitfalls-to-avoid">Pitfalls to avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treating Wikipedia like a book with a single author</strong>. Most entries do not have one.</li>
<li><strong>Using initials for authors</strong> if you do cite a named author elsewhere. Your rule requires full first names.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting quotation marks</strong> around the entry title.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving out the container</strong>. <em>Wikipedia</em> should appear as the site name in italics.</li>
<li><strong>Citing only the homepage</strong>. Always cite the specific entry page you used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Why these rules matter for your reader</h2>
<p>MLA 9 is designed around helping your reader retrace your research path. With Wikipedia, the main risk is that the path changes. Using the entry title, the container <em>Wikipedia</em>, a stable URL when possible, and an accessed date creates a citation that is fair to your reader and credible for your work. It also shows that you understand Wikipedia’s strengths and limits, and that you are using it responsibly.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-wikipedia-page-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Wikipedia page in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, treat a Wikipedia article like an entry in a reference work on a website. In Works Cited, list the article title in quotation marks, then the website name in italics, the publisher (Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.), the publication date if shown, the URL, and your access date. Practical scenario, you used the “Photosynthesis” article for a quick definition. Your entry would look like: “Photosynthesis.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., last modified 12 Dec. 2025, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026. If the page shows “Last edited on” rather than “last modified,” you can use that date as the publication date. For in text citation, use the article title in parentheses, for example (“Photosynthesis”). For MLA guidance, see the MLA Handbook principles and MLA style resources, https://style.mla.org/ and https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_electronic_sources.html.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-cite-the-wikipedia-article-or-the-sources-listed-at-the-bottom">Should I cite the Wikipedia article or the sources listed at the bottom?</h3>
<p>If you rely on information that Wikipedia summarizes, you should usually cite the original source listed in the References section, not Wikipedia. Practical scenario, you need a statistic or a historical claim for a research paper. Click the footnote number in Wikipedia, open the cited book, journal article, or reputable website, and cite that source directly. That strengthens credibility and avoids citing a tertiary summary. Cite Wikipedia only when you are discussing Wikipedia itself, defining a term for a low stakes assignment, or when your instructor explicitly allows it as a starting point. If you used Wikipedia for background and then confirmed details elsewhere, cite the sources you actually used for your claims. If you quote Wikipedia wording, then cite Wikipedia. For evaluating sources and choosing what to cite, see MLA’s research guidance, https://style.mla.org/research/, and Purdue OWL on evaluating sources, https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/conducting_research/evaluating_sources_of_information/index.html.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-date-do-i-use-when-citing-wikipedia-in-mla-and-do-i-need-an-access-date">What date do I use when citing Wikipedia in MLA, and do I need an access date?</h3>
<p>Use the date Wikipedia provides as the last update date. On most pages, this appears as “last edited” at the bottom, and it functions like a publication date because the content changes over time. If you cannot find a clear date, you may omit it, but include an access date since Wikipedia is updated frequently. Practical scenario, you consulted a biography page that changed between drafts of your paper. Including an access date helps readers understand which version you saw. MLA 9 recommends access dates for online works that are likely to change, and Wikipedia fits that category. Format the date as day month year, for example 1 Jan. 2026. If you are citing a stable archived version, you can cite that version’s date and still include access date if you want extra clarity. For date and access date rules, see MLA Style Center, https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-specific-section-or-quote-from-a-wikipedia-article-in-mla-in-text-citations">How do I cite a specific section or quote from a Wikipedia article in MLA in-text citations?</h3>
<p>For MLA in text citations, use the article title in parentheses because Wikipedia entries usually do not have a single author. If you quote a sentence from a specific section, you can add the section name in your prose for clarity, but MLA in text citations generally do not require section labels. Practical scenario, you quote a line from the “Reception” section of a film article. You might write, In the “Reception” section of the Wikipedia entry, the film is described as “…” (“Film Title”). If your instructor wants more precision, consider citing the permanent link to the exact version you used, then the reader can locate the passage in that revision. If you must cite a particular paragraph, MLA does not mandate paragraph numbers for web pages, but you can mention the section and a brief description of location in your sentence. For in text citation basics, see https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-wikipedia-if-there-is-no-author-or-if-there-are-many-editors">How do I cite Wikipedia if there is no author, or if there are many editors?</h3>
<p>Do not list “Wikipedia contributors” as the author in MLA 9. Wikipedia is collaboratively edited, so MLA practice is to start the Works Cited entry with the article title. Practical scenario, you are citing “French Revolution” and you cannot identify a single author. Begin with: “French Revolution.” Then list Wikipedia as the container, followed by Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the last edited date, the URL, and your access date. In text, cite the title in parentheses, for example (“French Revolution”). If you are writing about Wikipedia as a community project, you can mention Wikipedia editors in your discussion, but keep the citation itself aligned with MLA’s web source model. If you are citing a talk page or a user page, treat it as a web page with the page title and the site name, and include the URL and access date. For MLA’s author guidance, see https://style.mla.org/citing-no-author/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-specific-version-of-a-wikipedia-page-so-my-reader-sees-what-i-saw">How do I cite a specific version of a Wikipedia page so my reader sees what I saw?</h3>
<p>Use Wikipedia’s “Permanent link” feature to cite a fixed revision. Practical scenario, your instructor wants sources that can be checked later, and you worry the page will change. Click “View history,” select the revision you used, then click “permanent link.” Use that URL in your Works Cited entry. Your citation still starts with the article title, followed by Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, Inc., the date and time of that revision if shown, the permanent link URL, and your access date. This approach is especially helpful when quoting or when the page is controversial and frequently updated. In your paper, you can also note that you cited a specific revision. For more on citing web pages and stable URLs, see MLA Style Center’s Works Cited guidance, https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/, and Wikipedia’s help on permanent links, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Permanent_link.</p>
