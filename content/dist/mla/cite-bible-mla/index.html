<section class="content-section" id="citing-the-bible-in-mla-9-what-makes-it-different">
<h2 >Citing the Bible in MLA 9, what makes it different</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, the Bible is treated as a well known, frequently republished work. That means your citation needs to tell readers which version you used and exactly where the passage appears. Unlike a typical book, a Bible citation usually does not rely on page numbers. Instead, you cite the book, chapter, and verse.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you will do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the Bible version you used</strong> (for example, New Revised Standard Version, King James Version, New International Version).</li>
<li><strong>Cite the passage using book, chapter, and verse</strong> (for example, John 3.16).</li>
</ol>
<p>MLA also expects consistency. Once you establish the version, you should keep using it unless you intentionally switch versions and then you must label the change.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-rule-include-the-version-and-the-passage">
<h2 >The core rule, include the version and the passage</h2>
<h3 id="in-text-citations-the-most-common-need">In text citations (the most common need)</h3>
<p>MLA in text citations for the Bible normally include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Book name</strong> (often abbreviated in MLA style if you choose, but be consistent)</li>
<li><strong>Chapter and verse</strong>, separated by periods in MLA style</li>
<li><strong>Bible version</strong>, usually included the first time you cite that version, and again any time you switch versions</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical first in text citation looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>(John 3.16, <em>New Revised Standard Version</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, if you keep using the same version throughout the paper, you can usually omit the version in later citations:</p>
<ul>
<li>(John 3.16)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your instructor may prefer that you include the version every time. If so, follow that requirement.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-only-sometimes-required">Works Cited entry (only sometimes required)</h3>
<p>MLA practice varies here. Many instructors do not require a Works Cited entry for the Bible because it is a common reference work. However, MLA allows and often encourages a Works Cited entry if you are using a specific published edition, an online Bible, or if your instructor requests it.</p>
<p>If you include a Works Cited entry, you typically cite the <strong>version</strong> as the title, then the <strong>editor or translator if relevant</strong>, then the <strong>publisher and year</strong>, and then the <strong>database or website</strong> if accessed online.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="how-your-author-rules-apply-to-the-bible">
<h2 >How your author rules apply to the Bible</h2>
<p>You listed strict author rules, including full first names, name inversion, and how to handle multiple authors. For Bible citations, those rules usually do not apply in the normal way, because the Bible is not cited by a single modern author in MLA. Instead, MLA treats the Bible as a titled work, and the key identifying detail is the <strong>version</strong>.</p>
<p>That said, your rules still matter in two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Bible edition that credits an editor or translator prominently</strong>, and you choose to include that person in the Works Cited entry.</li>
<li><strong>A study Bible or commentary</strong>, where the notes are written by named authors. That is not “the Bible” as a source, it is a secondary source about the Bible, and your author rules apply fully.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is no credited author or editor you are using as the main entry, you start with the <strong>title</strong>, which fits your “NO AUTHOR” rule.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-in-text-citation-for-a-single-verse-first-and-later-citations">
<h2 >Example 1, in text citation for a single verse (first and later citations)</h2>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>You quote John 3:16 using the New Revised Standard Version.</p>
<h3 id="correct-mla-in-text-citation-first-time-you-use-that-version">Correct MLA in text citation, first time you use that version</h3>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son …” (John 3.16, <em>New Revised Standard Version</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- It gives the <strong>exact location</strong> using book, chapter, and verse.<br />
- It identifies the <strong>version</strong>, which matters because wording varies by translation.<br />
- It uses MLA’s typical punctuation pattern, the citation goes at the end of the sentence before the period.</p>
<h3 id="correct-mla-in-text-citation-later-in-the-same-paper-same-version">Correct MLA in text citation, later in the same paper (same version)</h3>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>The passage connects belief with life (John 3.16).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why the rule matters</strong><br />
If you do not name the version at least once, a reader cannot verify your quotation easily, because the same verse can be phrased differently across versions. That can change the nuance of an argument.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-citing-a-passage-range-and-showing-correct-formatting">
<h2 >Example 2, citing a passage range and showing correct formatting</h2>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>You summarize a section, not a single verse, from Paul’s discussion of love in 1 Corinthians, using the King James Version.</p>
<h3 id="correct-mla-in-text-citation-for-a-range">Correct MLA in text citation for a range</h3>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Paul describes love as patient and kind, and he emphasizes what love does not do (1 Cor. 13.4-7, <em>King James Version</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- It uses a <strong>range</strong> with a hyphen: 13.4-7.<br />
- It abbreviates the biblical book name, which MLA allows, as long as you are consistent.<br />
- It includes the <strong>version</strong> to lock in the wording and style of the translation.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you cite multiple verses that are not continuous, use commas:<br />
- (1 Cor. 13.4, 13.6-7)</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-3-works-cited-entry-for-an-online-bible-no-author-start-with-title">
<h2 >Example 3, Works Cited entry for an online Bible (no author, start with title)</h2>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>You used an online Bible text on a website. You want a Works Cited entry because your instructor requires it, and because you accessed a specific site.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-example-online-bible">Works Cited example (online Bible)</h3>
<p><em>New Revised Standard Version.</em> Bible Gateway, www.biblegateway.com. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- It follows your “NO AUTHOR” approach by starting with the <strong>title</strong>, here the version name.<br />
- It names the <strong>website</strong> as the container.<br />
- It includes a <strong>URL</strong> and an <strong>access date</strong>, which is often helpful for web content that can be updated or displayed differently.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Do not list “The Bible” as the author. In MLA, the Bible is not typically cited with an author field. The version is what matters most for identification.</p>

<p>Bible translations differ. Even when the meaning is similar, the phrasing can shift enough to affect your analysis. Naming the version prevents confusion and strengthens your credibility.</p>
<h3 id="bible-references-are-not-page-based">Bible references are not page based</h3>
<p>Page numbers vary across editions, fonts, and digital layouts. Book, chapter, and verse is the stable system that works across print and online formats.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips for getting Bible citations right</h2>
<h3 id="tip-1-decide-early-whether-you-will-abbreviate-book-names">Tip 1, decide early whether you will abbreviate book names</h3>
<p>Both of these can be correct, but do not mix them randomly:<br />
- John 3.16<br />
- Jn. 3.16</p>
<p>If you abbreviate, do it consistently throughout the paper.</p>
<h3 id="tip-2-use-periods-between-chapter-and-verse-in-mla-style">Tip 2, use periods between chapter and verse in MLA style</h3>
<p>MLA commonly formats it as:<br />
- John 3.16<br />
not:<br />
- John 3:16</p>
<p>Some instructors accept colons because they are widely used. If your class has a preference, follow it, but MLA style typically uses periods.</p>
<h3 id="tip-3-introduce-the-version-in-the-text-if-it-helps">Tip 3, introduce the version in the text if it helps</h3>
<p>Sometimes the smoothest option is to name the version in your sentence, then cite only the passage:</p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>In the <em>New Revised Standard Version</em>, the verse emphasizes “the world” as the object of God’s love (John 3.16).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tip-4-treat-study-bible-notes-as-a-different-source">Tip 4, treat study Bible notes as a different source</h3>
<p>If you quote a footnote, introduction, or commentary inside a study Bible, you may need to cite the author of that note, and then your author name rules apply. The Bible text and the commentary are not the same thing.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your The Bible citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="overview-what-makes-bible-citations-special-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Overview, what makes Bible citations “special” in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing the Bible in MLA 9 has a few edge cases that do not come up with most books. The main reason is that people read the Bible in many forms, print editions, study Bibles, websites, and apps. Also, readers often quote very small parts, like a single verse, and the same verse can look different across translations.</p>
<p>In MLA, you generally treat the Bible as a <strong>work with a title</strong>, not a work with a personal author. That matters because your Works Cited entry usually begins with the <strong>title of the version you used</strong>, not with a person’s name. Your in-text citation then points readers to the <strong>book, chapter, and verse</strong>. The goal is simple: a reader should be able to find the exact translation and the exact passage you used, even if they use a different Bible.</p>
<p>A key rule that drives many “special cases” is this: <strong>you must name the translation or version</strong>, because wording changes across translations. Another key rule is that <strong>chapter and verse are not page numbers</strong>, so you cite them as a standardized location marker.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="works-cited-versus-in-text-citations-what-goes-where">
<h2 >Works Cited versus in-text citations, what goes where</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-usually-optional-but-sometimes-necessary">Works Cited entry, usually optional but sometimes necessary</h3>
<p>MLA allows you to cite the Bible <strong>in-text without a Works Cited entry</strong> in many school contexts, especially when you use a well-known print Bible and you are not focusing on the Bible as a publication. However, many instructors and institutions prefer a Works Cited entry anyway. If you use a specific edition, a study Bible, a website, or an app, a Works Cited entry becomes much more important.</p>
<p>Practical tip: if your Bible has an editor, a study Bible title, a publisher, or a website container, you are no longer citing “just the Bible” in the abstract. You are citing a particular publication, so include it in Works Cited.</p>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-always-required-when-quoting-or-paraphrasing">In-text citation, always required when quoting or paraphrasing</h3>
<p>In-text citations for the Bible should include:<br />
- The <strong>book name</strong> (often abbreviated in MLA style, but be consistent)<br />
- The <strong>chapter and verse(s)</strong>, separated by a period<br />
- The <strong>version</strong> the first time you cite it (and whenever it might be unclear)</p>
<p>Example pattern: <em>(Book Chapter.Verse, Version)</em></p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-naming-the-translation-and-keeping-it-consistent">
<h2 >Special case 1, naming the translation and keeping it consistent</h2>
<p>Because translations differ, MLA expects you to identify the version. The most common edge case is when writers forget to name the version, or they switch translations mid-paper without signaling it.</p>
<p>Practical tips:<br />
- Pick one version for the whole paper if possible.<br />
- If you use multiple versions, <strong>label every citation clearly</strong>, or at least label each version the first time it appears and whenever you change.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: writing <em>(John 3.16)</em> with no version. That forces the reader to guess which wording you used.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-citing-multiple-verses-ranges-and-nonconsecutive-passages">
<h2 >Special case 2, citing multiple verses, ranges, and nonconsecutive passages</h2>
<p>Bible passages can be cited in several “small location” patterns. The edge cases come from punctuation and clarity.</p>
<ul>
<li>A range within the same chapter: <em>John 3.16-18</em></li>
<li>A range that crosses chapters: <em>John 3.16-4.2</em></li>
<li>Nonconsecutive verses: <em>John 3.16, 19, 21</em></li>
<li>Multiple separate passages: <em>John 3.16; 6.35; 8.12</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Practical tip: use semicolons to separate distinct passages. Use commas for nonconsecutive verses in the same chapter.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: using page numbers instead of chapter and verse. Page numbers vary by edition, so chapter and verse is the stable locator.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-books-with-numbered-names-and-short-books">
<h2 >Special case 3, books with numbered names and short books</h2>
<p>Books like <strong>1 Samuel</strong>, <strong>2 Corinthians</strong>, and <strong>1 John</strong> can cause formatting mistakes.</p>
<p>Practical tips:<br />
- Keep the number with the book name: <em>1 Cor.</em> or <em>1 Corinthians</em>.<br />
- Be consistent with abbreviations. If you abbreviate “Corinthians” as “Cor.” once, do it throughout.</p>
<p>Very short books, like <strong>Jude</strong> or <strong>Obadiah</strong>, have only one chapter in many traditions. Some writers mistakenly cite “chapter 1” anyway. It is not wrong to include it, but you should follow your chosen format consistently. Many writers still use the standard chapter.verse pattern, for example <em>Jude 1.3-4</em>.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-quoting-from-an-online-bible-or-an-app">
<h2 >Special case 4, quoting from an online Bible or an app</h2>
<p>If you read the Bible on a website or in an app, you are also citing a digital container. The edge cases here include missing publication dates, changing URLs, and unclear version labeling on the page.</p>
<p>For MLA 9 Works Cited entries for web sources, include:<br />
- Title of the Bible or version<br />
- Title of the website (container)<br />
- Publisher of the website (if given)<br />
- Date (if given)<br />
- URL<br />
- Access date, if your instructor requires it or if content is likely to change</p>
<p>Practical tip: many Bible sites show the version clearly at the top of the passage. Capture that information when you take notes.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: citing only the website and forgetting the version, for example citing “BibleGateway” without saying NIV, KJV, NRSVUE, and so on.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-study-bibles-editors-and-no-author-rules">
<h2 >Special case 5, study Bibles, editors, and “no author” rules</h2>
<p>Study Bibles often have editors and additional content like introductions, notes, and essays. This creates an important edge case: you might be citing the <strong>biblical text</strong>, or you might be citing the <strong>study notes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you quote the biblical text itself, you still cite by book, chapter, and verse in-text.</li>
<li>If you quote study notes or an essay in the study Bible, you may need to cite it like a section of a book, sometimes with an editor as the contributor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your rule set says: <strong>NO AUTHOR, start with title</strong>. That fits many Bible situations because the Bible is commonly treated as a title-led work in MLA. Even when editors exist, the “author” field is not usually a person for the biblical text itself.</p>
<p>Practical tip: if your quote is from a footnote or commentary, label it clearly in your prose, and cite the page number for that note if the note is paginated.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: treating “God” or “Moses” as the author in the Works Cited entry. MLA does not handle the Bible that way in most academic contexts.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-formatting-matters">Why this formatting matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semicolons separate distinct locations, which makes the citation easy to scan.</li>
<li>Cross-chapter ranges must show both chapters so readers can follow the passage accurately.</li>
<li>Including the version protects you from disputes about wording when you quote or closely paraphrase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common pitfall: writing <em>John 3:16-4:2</em> is common in religious contexts, but MLA typically uses a period between chapter and verse. If you use colons, be consistent and follow your instructor’s preference. Many MLA instructors still accept colons, but consistency is essential.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter, clarity, trust, and repeatability</h2>
<p>Bible citations can become messy because many readers assume “everyone knows the verse.” Academic writing expects the opposite. Readers need to verify your wording and context. Stating the translation, using stable locators, and separating multiple passages clearly does three things:<br />
1. <strong>Clarity</strong>, readers can find your exact text quickly.<br />
2. <strong>Trust</strong>, your quotations are verifiable.<br />
3. <strong>Repeatability</strong>, another writer can follow your method and reach the same passage.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-bible-verse-in-mla-9-in-my-paper-in-text-citation">How do I cite a Bible verse in MLA 9 in my paper (in-text citation)?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, Bible passages are usually cited in the text, not with footnotes. In your first in-text citation, name the version you used, then give the book, chapter, and verse using periods between numbers. Example: (New Revised Standard Version, John 3.16). After you identify the version once, you can usually omit it in later citations if it stays the same, for example (John 3.16). Use the standard book name, and do not add “p.” or page numbers. If you quote multiple verses, use a range like (John 3.16-18). If you cite a whole chapter, use (John 3). If you are comparing versions, keep the version name in each relevant citation. For more guidance, see the MLA handbook style overview at https://style.mla.org/ and the Purdue OWL MLA section at https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-put-the-bible-in-my-works-cited-list-in-mla-9">Do I need to put the Bible in my Works Cited list in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Often, you do not need to include the Bible in Works Cited if you are using a common print Bible and only citing passages in-text, since MLA treats the Bible as a well known reference. However, you should include an entry when your instructor requires it, when you used a specific edition with an editor or translator that matters, or when you used an online Bible or app where the container and URL help readers retrieve the text. A practical scenario is using BibleGateway or YouVersion, in that case a Works Cited entry is helpful because the site functions like a source container. If you do include it, list the title of the version, the editor or translator if given, the publisher, and the year, plus the website and URL for online sources. For MLA examples, consult https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-online-bible-like-biblegateway-or-youversion-in-mla-9">How do I cite an online Bible like BibleGateway or YouVersion in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Treat an online Bible like a work accessed through a website container. Start with the title of the Bible, usually the version name, in italics. Then add the website name as the container, the publisher or sponsor if listed, the publication date if available, and the URL. You can also include an access date if the content is likely to change or if your instructor asks for it. In-text, cite the version and the passage, for example (English Standard Version, Gen. 1.1). A practical scenario is quoting from BibleGateway for a literature paper, you would keep the in-text citation focused on book, chapter, and verse, while the Works Cited entry tells readers where you retrieved that version online. If the site lets you select versions, be sure your Works Cited entry matches the version you cite. For help building entries, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_electronic_sources.html.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-is-the-correct-way-to-format-book-chapter-and-verse-in-mla-colons-or-periods">What is the correct way to format book, chapter, and verse in MLA (colons or periods)?</h3>
<p>MLA style typically uses periods between chapter and verse numbers, not colons. So you would write John 3.16, not John 3:16, inside your parenthetical citation. This is one of the most common points of confusion because many Bibles print references with colons. Keep your formatting consistent across your paper. If you cite multiple verses, use a hyphen for a range, for example (John 3.16-18). If you cite nonconsecutive verses, separate them with commas, for example (John 3.16, 19). A practical scenario is analyzing a theme across several verses in the same chapter, you can cite the chapter once if you summarize broadly, then cite specific verses when you quote exact wording. If your instructor prefers colons, follow their directions. For MLA citation basics, see https://style.mla.org/parenthetical-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-the-bible-if-i-switch-between-different-translations-or-editions">How do I cite the Bible if I switch between different translations or editions?</h3>
<p>If you use more than one translation, identify the version in each in-text citation where ambiguity could occur. Example: (King James Version, Ps. 23.1) and (New International Version, Ps. 23.1). This matters because wording can differ significantly across translations, and your argument may depend on those differences. In your prose, you can also clarify, for example, “In the NIV, the verse reads,” then cite the passage. In Works Cited, include separate entries for each version if you used different publications or different websites. A practical scenario is comparing Romans 12.2 in the NRSV and the NIV for a theology assignment, you should cite each version clearly so readers can verify the language you discuss. For general MLA guidance on identifying versions and maintaining consistency, see https://style.mla.org/ and https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-bible-passage-in-a-signal-phrase-and-what-if-i-quote-multiple-verses-in-one-block-quote">How do I cite a Bible passage in a signal phrase, and what if I quote multiple verses in one block quote?</h3>
<p>If you introduce a quotation with a signal phrase, you still include a parenthetical citation after the quotation, unless the citation information is fully clear and your instructor allows omission. Example: According to the New Revised Standard Version, “For God so loved the world” (John 3.16). If you use a block quote, place the parenthetical citation after the final punctuation of the block. When quoting multiple verses, cite the full range, for example (John 3.16-18). A practical scenario is a close reading where you quote several lines from Psalms, set it as a block quote if it meets the length threshold for your paper, then cite the book and verse range at the end. Remember to identify the version at least once, and keep it consistent. For MLA rules on quotations and block formatting, see https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_quotations.html.</p>
