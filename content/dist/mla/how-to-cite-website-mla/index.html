<h2 >MLA 9 Website Citations, How to Format Them Correctly</h2>
<p>An MLA 9 website citation (in your Works Cited list) is built from a set of core elements in a specific order. The goal is consistency, so readers can quickly identify what you used, who created it, where it was published, and how to find it. MLA 9 is flexible because websites vary a lot, but it still expects you to include the most useful details available.</p>
<p>This guide focuses on website pages and articles, which are the most common web sources students cite.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-9-format-for-a-webpage">
<h2 >The Basic MLA 9 Format for a Webpage</h2>
<p>Use this general template for a page on a website:</p>
<p><strong>Author Last, First Middle. "Title of Webpage." <em>Website Name</em>, Publisher (if different from website name), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Not every webpage has every part. MLA 9 expects you to include what is available and skip what is not.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-elements-explained-simply">
<h2 >The Core Elements, Explained Simply</h2>
<h3 id="1-author">1) Author</h3>
<p>If a person wrote the page, list them first.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use full first names, not initials.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Invert the first author’s name:</strong> Last, First Middle.  </li>
<li>If there is <strong>no author</strong>, start with the title of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: MLA Works Cited entries are alphabetized. Inverting the first author’s name makes sorting predictable and helps readers scan your list.</p>
<h3 id="2-title-of-the-webpage-in-quotation-marks">2) Title of the Webpage (in quotation marks)</h3>
<p>Put the specific page title in quotation marks.</p>
<p>Example: <code>"How to Start Composting"</code></p>
<p>Why this matters: Websites contain many pages. The page title tells readers exactly which part of the site you used.</p>
<h3 id="3-website-name-in-italics">3) Website Name (in italics)</h3>
<p>Italicize the overall website name, like <em>BBC</em>, <em>Mayo Clinic</em>, or <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>
<p>Why this matters: The website name is often the “container” that holds the page. It helps readers understand the source’s context and credibility.</p>
<h3 id="4-publisher-or-sponsoring-organization-only-if-different">4) Publisher or Sponsoring Organization (only if different)</h3>
<p>Sometimes the publisher is separate from the website name. If the website name and publisher are the same, you usually do not repeat it.</p>
<p>Why this matters: The publisher can clarify who is responsible for the content, especially when the site name is a brand and the publisher is an institution.</p>
<h3 id="5-date-when-the-page-was-published-or-last-updated">5) Date (when the page was published or last updated)</h3>
<p>Use the format <strong>Day Month Year</strong>, like <code>12 Oct. 2023</code>. If the page only shows a year, use just the year.</p>
<p>Why this matters: Web content changes. Dates help readers judge how current your information is and help them locate the correct version.</p>
<h3 id="6-url">6) URL</h3>
<p>Include the direct link. MLA 9 allows you to omit <code>https://</code> in many classrooms, but your instructor may prefer that you keep it. Either way, be consistent.</p>
<p>Why this matters: URLs make sources findable. They are especially important for online-only content.</p>
<h3 id="7-accessed-date-often-optional-sometimes-recommended">7) Accessed Date (often optional, sometimes recommended)</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats the accessed date as optional, but it is a good idea when:<br />
- There is no publication date.<br />
- The content is likely to change.<br />
- Your instructor requires it.</p>
<p>Format: <code>Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</code></p>
<p>Why this matters: If the page changes later, the accessed date shows when you viewed it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-including-multi-author-pages">
<h2 >Author Rules You Must Follow (Including Multi Author Pages)</h2>
<h3 id="one-author">One author</h3>
<p><strong>Last, First Middle.</strong><br />
Use the author’s full first name, not initials.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted.</li>
<li>Second author is in normal order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format:<br />
<strong>Last, First Middle, and First Last.</strong></p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>List only the first author, inverted.</li>
<li>Add <strong>et al.</strong> right after the first author.</li>
<li>Do not list other authors before et al.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format:<br />
<strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<h3 id="no-author">No author</h3>
<p>Start with the title of the webpage. Do not use Anonymous. Do not use n.d.</p>
<p>Format starts like:<br />
<strong>"Title of Webpage." <em>Website Name</em>, ...</strong></p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-detailed-explanations">
<h2 >Examples (With Detailed Explanations)</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-one-author-webpage-most-common-case">Example 1, One Author Webpage (Most Common Case)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>Nguyen, Alicia Marie. "How to Start Composting in Small Apartments." <em>Green Living Journal</em>, 18 Mar. 2024, https://greenlivingjournal.org/composting-small-apartments. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way:</strong><br />
- <strong>Nguyen, Alicia Marie</strong> is inverted because she is the first and only author. Her first name is written in full.<br />
- The page title is in <strong>quotation marks</strong> because it is a specific page, not the whole website.<br />
- <em>Green Living Journal</em> is italicized because it is the website container.<br />
- The date is written <strong>18 Mar. 2024</strong> in MLA style.<br />
- The URL is included to help the reader locate the exact page.<br />
- The accessed date is included because web content can change, and it adds clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> Copy the page title from the webpage, but check capitalization. MLA uses title case, so major words are capitalized.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-webpage-correct-use-of-and">Example 2, Two Authors Webpage (Correct Use of “and”)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>Martinez, Sofia Elena, and Daniel Cho. "Understanding Heat Waves and Urban Heat Islands." <em>Climate Data Insights</em>, 7 Aug. 2023, https://climatedatainsights.org/heat-waves-urban-heat-islands.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way:</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted: <strong>Martinez, Sofia Elena</strong>.<br />
- The second author is not inverted: <strong>Daniel Cho</strong>.<br />
- The word <strong>and</strong> connects the two authors, as MLA prefers.<br />
- The page title is in quotes, the website name is italicized, and the date and URL follow.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Many students invert both authors. In MLA, only the first author is inverted in the Works Cited entry for two authors.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-webpage-start-with-the-title">Example 3, No Author Webpage (Start With the Title)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>"Scholarship Application Checklist." <em>Riverview University Financial Aid</em>, Riverview University, 2 Jan. 2025, https://financialaid.riverview.edu/scholarships/checklist. Accessed 31 Dec. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way:</strong><br />
- There is <strong>no listed author</strong>, so the citation begins with the webpage title in quotation marks.<br />
- The website name is italicized: <em>Riverview University Financial Aid</em>.<br />
- The publisher is included as <strong>Riverview University</strong> because it clarifies the institution behind the site section, and it can be different from the section name.<br />
- The accessed date is useful because administrative pages can be updated often.</p>
<p><strong>Alphabetizing note:</strong> When a citation starts with a title, alphabetize by the first important word. Ignore A, An, and The.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-for-getting-website-citations-right">
<h2 >Practical Tips for Getting Website Citations Right</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for the author near the title or at the top and bottom of the page.</strong> Also check an “About” link or an author bio.</li>
<li><strong>Use the most specific date available.</strong> If you see “Last updated,” you can usually use that date.</li>
<li><strong>Use a stable URL when possible.</strong> If the site provides a “permalink,” use it.</li>
<li><strong>Do not cite the homepage if you used a specific page.</strong> Cite the page you actually read.</li>
<li><strong>Keep punctuation exact.</strong> Quotation marks for the page title, italics for the website name, periods and commas in the standard MLA order.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials for authors.</strong> Your rule requires full first names, so write “Jordan Michael,” not “J. M.”</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author in a two author citation.</strong> Only the first author is inverted.</li>
<li><strong>Listing all authors for three or more authors.</strong> Use the first author plus et al.</li>
<li><strong>Putting the website name in quotation marks.</strong> The website name should be italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Using n.d. for missing dates.</strong> MLA 9 does not require n.d. Skip the date if none is provided, and consider adding an accessed date.</li>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Website Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-and-edge-cases-for-mla-9-website-citations">
<h2 >Special cases and edge cases for MLA 9 website citations</h2>
<p>MLA 9 treats a “website citation” as a flexible set of core elements. Many web pages do not include every element, or they include confusing versions of them. The goal is to cite what you can verify, present it in a consistent order, and help readers find the exact page you used.</p>
<p>Your author rules matter because Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element, usually the author’s last name. Using full first names also reduces confusion between people with similar initials and better reflects author identity. Correct author formatting also signals that you are using MLA style carefully and consistently.</p>
<p>Below are the most common special cases and edge cases, plus practical tips and pitfalls.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="1-author-problems-and-tricky-bylines">
<h2 >1) Author problems and tricky bylines</h2>
<h3 id="a-no-author-listed">A) No author listed</h3>
<p>If there is no individual or group author, start with the page title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” The title becomes the first element.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for an author in the byline area, the page header, the footer, an “About” section, or an author profile link. If none exists, treat it as no author.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using the website name as the author when the page does not actually credit the organization. Only use an organization as author if it is clearly presented as the author.</p>
<h3 id="b-group-or-organization-as-author">B) Group or organization as author</h3>
<p>Many pages are written by an organization, such as a museum, a government agency, or a professional association. If the organization is clearly the author, use it as the author.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the organization is both the author and the website name, you usually list it once as the author, then omit it as the container to avoid repetition.</p>
<h3 id="c-two-authors-and-three-or-more-authors">C) Two authors and three or more authors</h3>
<p>Follow your rules exactly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> first author inverted, second author normal order, use <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors:</strong> first author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong> only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing all authors on a web page with many contributors. MLA allows shortening to keep citations readable, and your rule requires et al. for three or more.</p>
<h3 id="d-username-handle-or-missing-full-first-name">D) Username, handle, or missing full first name</h3>
<p>Sometimes a web page credits a username or a handle instead of a real name. MLA prefers the name as presented. If you can verify the person’s full name from an official profile on the same site, you may use it, but do not guess.</p>
<p><strong>Practical approach:</strong><br />
- Use the author name exactly as shown if a full name is not available.<br />
- If a profile clearly provides the full name, use that full name.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="2-titles-that-are-missing-unclear-or-overly-long">
<h2 >2) Titles that are missing, unclear, or overly long</h2>
<h3 id="a-no-clear-page-title">A) No clear page title</h3>
<p>A page may have a vague heading like “Home,” or the title may be missing in the browser tab. Use the most specific title you can find, often the main heading at the top of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the page is a PDF or report hosted on a website, the document title usually matters more than the web page wrapper.</p>
<h3 id="b-titles-with-subtitles">B) Titles with subtitles</h3>
<p>If the page uses a title and subtitle, include both, separated by a colon.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Copying an entire navigation breadcrumb trail as the title. Use the actual page title, not the menu path.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="3-dates-updates-and-what-to-do-when-dates-are-messy">
<h2 >3) Dates, updates, and what to do when dates are messy</h2>
<h3 id="a-no-publication-date">A) No publication date</h3>
<p>MLA 9 does not require a date, and you should not insert “n.d.” If there is no date, omit it.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check for “Published,” “Updated,” “Last modified,” or a date near the headline. Use the most relevant date that reflects the version you read, often the update date if it is clearly labeled.</p>
<h3 id="b-multiple-dates-on-one-page">B) Multiple dates on one page</h3>
<p>If a page shows both “Published” and “Updated,” you can usually cite the most recent date if it represents the version you consulted. If the update date is minor and the original publication date is more meaningful, you can use the publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using a copyright year from the footer as the page’s publication date. A site-wide copyright year is not the same as a page date.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="4-containers-website-names-and-when-to-repeat-or-omit">
<h2 >4) Containers, website names, and when to repeat or omit</h2>
<p>In MLA, the “container” is the larger whole that contains the source. For a web page, the container is usually the website name.</p>
<h3 id="a-website-name-is-the-same-as-the-author">A) Website name is the same as the author</h3>
<p>If the organization is author and the website name is identical, list it once to avoid redundancy.</p>
<h3 id="b-website-name-differs-from-the-publisher-or-sponsoring-organization">B) Website name differs from the publisher or sponsoring organization</h3>
<p>Some sites have a brand name, but the publisher is a different organization. MLA often treats the website name as the container, and the publisher is optional for many web sources. Include a publisher if it helps clarify responsibility and is clearly stated.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the publisher is the same as the website name, omit the publisher.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="5-urls-permalinks-and-paywalls">
<h2 >5) URLs, permalinks, and paywalls</h2>
<h3 id="a-long-urls-with-tracking">A) Long URLs with tracking</h3>
<p>Use the cleanest stable URL you can. Remove tracking parameters when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Copying a URL that includes session IDs, long tracking strings, or “utm” parameters.</p>
<h3 id="b-dois-versus-urls">B) DOIs versus URLs</h3>
<p>If a DOI exists, it is usually preferred for scholarly content. Many “website” items are actually journal articles displayed on the web.</p>
<h3 id="c-paywalled-pages">C) Paywalled pages</h3>
<p>Still cite the page you accessed. If a stable permalink is offered, use it.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="6-access-date-when-it-is-useful-and-when-it-is-optional">
<h2 >6) Access date, when it is useful and when it is optional</h2>
<p>MLA 9 allows access dates, and they are often helpful for web pages that change frequently or do not have a clear publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Use an access date when:</strong><br />
- No publication date is provided.<br />
- The content is likely to change, such as dashboards, live pages, or wiki entries.<br />
- You need to document the version you consulted.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Adding an access date to everything without thinking. It is not wrong, but it is most meaningful in the cases above.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="7-parts-of-a-page-sections-and-anchored-headings">
<h2 >7) Parts of a page, sections, and anchored headings</h2>
<p>Sometimes you cite a specific section of a long page, such as an FAQ answer or a specific heading. MLA does not require an anchor link, but you can include it if it helps readers locate the section.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the page is very long, consider naming the section in your in-text citation or prose, and use the standard Works Cited entry for the full page.</p>

- <strong>Date included:</strong> The publication date is clear.<br />
- <strong>URL included:</strong> It directs readers to the exact page.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the page lists “M. E. Garcia,” do not convert initials to a full first name unless the site clearly provides the full name. Your rule requires full first names, so verify from an author profile or the byline’s expanded view before changing it.</p>

<h2 >Example 2: Three or more authors, use et al., and include an access date because content changes</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong><br />
Patel, Aisha Noor, et al. “Global Air Quality Dashboard.” <em>World Atmosphere Data Portal</em>, https://data.worldatmosphere.org/air-quality. Accessed 12 Dec. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Three or more authors:</strong> Only the first author is listed, inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong><br />
- <strong>No date on page:</strong> Instead of adding “n.d.,” the date is omitted.<br />
- <strong>Access date included:</strong> A dashboard changes, so the access date helps document what you consulted.<br />
- <strong>Website name italicized:</strong> <em>World Atmosphere Data Portal</em> is the container.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing all authors before et al. Your rule requires only the first author, then et al.</p>

<h2 >Example 3: No author, start with title, and handle organization repetition</h2>

“Student Privacy and Online Learning: Frequently Asked Questions.” <em>Office of Academic Compliance</em>, 3 Mar. 2023, https://www.oac.edu/policies/student-privacy-online-learning-faq.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>No author:</strong> The entry starts with the page title in quotation marks.<br />
- <strong>Title leads alphabetization:</strong> In your Works Cited list, alphabetize by the first significant word in the title, ignoring “A,” “An,” and “The.”<br />
- <strong>Container included:</strong> <em>Office of Academic Compliance</em> is the website name.<br />
- <strong>Date and URL included:</strong> Both help readers locate the source.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the page clearly states “Office of Academic Compliance” as the author in a byline, then it should move to the author position. If it is only the site name in the header, keep it as the container.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>Correct handling of edge cases makes your citations reliable and easy to verify. Web sources are especially prone to missing authors, changing content, and unclear dates. Following consistent author formatting, using accurate titles, and choosing stable links helps readers find the same material you used. It also strengthens your credibility because your Works Cited entries look consistent, complete, and intentional.</p>
<p>If you want, share one or two real URLs you are citing, and I can show the best MLA 9 Works Cited entry for each using your author rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-website-in-mla-9-when-there-is-no-author">How do I cite a website in MLA 9 when there is no author?</h3>
<p>If a web page has no listed author, start the Works Cited entry with the page title in quotation marks. Then list the website name in italics, the publisher or sponsoring organization if it is different from the website name, the publication date (if available), the URL, and an access date only if it helps your reader (for example, content that changes often). In the in-text citation, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, for example, ("Campus Safety Tips"). Practical scenario: You are citing a university web page that lists safety guidelines but does not name a writer. Use the page title to anchor both the Works Cited entry and your in-text citation. For more guidance and examples, see the MLA Style Center, https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-is-the-correct-mla-9-format-for-a-web-page-citation-and-what-order-do-the-parts-go-in">What is the correct MLA 9 format for a web page citation, and what order do the parts go in?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 usually treats a specific web page as the source, not the entire website. A typical Works Cited entry follows this order: Author Last Name, First Name. "Title of Web Page." Website Name, Publisher or sponsor (if different), Day Month Year, URL. If there is no date, omit it. If there is no author, start with the page title. Practical scenario: You are citing an article on a news site. Use the article title in quotation marks and the news site name in italics, then include the date and URL. In-text citations typically use the author’s last name, or a shortened title if no author. For a detailed breakdown of core elements, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-include-the-access-date-when-citing-a-website-in-mla-9">Do I need to include the access date when citing a website in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Access dates are optional in MLA 9, but they are recommended when the content is likely to change, has no publication date, or is a page you suspect might be updated or removed. If you include it, place it at the end of the Works Cited entry as, Accessed 31 Dec. 2025. Practical scenario: You are citing a living document like a Wikipedia article, a dashboard with updated statistics, or a company policy page that changes over time. Adding an access date helps readers understand when you saw the information. If the page has a clear publication or last updated date and the content is stable, you can often omit the access date. For MLA’s guidance on when access dates help, see https://style.mla.org/when-to-use-accessed-in-a-citation/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-website-in-mla-9-if-there-is-no-date-or-the-page-only-says-updated">How do I cite a website in MLA 9 if there is no date or the page only says "updated"?</h3>
<p>If no publication date is provided, omit the date and move directly from the publisher or site name to the URL. If the page lists a last updated date, you can use that date as the publication date. MLA allows dates that indicate when the content was made available or last revised, as long as you present them as the date element in the citation. Practical scenario: You cite a nonprofit’s fact sheet that shows "Updated March 2024" at the bottom. Use that month and year as the date, for example, Mar. 2024. If there is no date at all, consider adding an access date, especially if the page is informational and may change. For more examples of handling missing dates, see https://style.mla.org/citing-articles-without-a-date/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-specific-page-on-a-website-versus-the-whole-website-in-mla-9">How do I cite a specific page on a website versus the whole website in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>In most academic writing, you should cite the specific web page you used, not the website homepage, because the page title and URL help readers find the exact content you referenced. Cite the whole website only when you are discussing the site as a whole, such as analyzing its design, purpose, or overall content. Practical scenario: If you quote a paragraph from a museum’s page about one exhibit, cite that exhibit page. If you are comparing museum websites for usability, you might cite the museum site generally. For a whole website, you may use the website name in italics as the title and include the URL, but omit a page title if you are not using a specific page. Additional guidance is available at https://style.mla.org/citing-a-website/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-mla-in-text-citations-for-a-website-when-there-are-no-page-numbers">How do I do MLA in-text citations for a website when there are no page numbers?</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations for web sources usually use the author’s last name in parentheses, even when there are no page numbers, for example, (Nguyen). If there is no author, use a shortened version of the web page title in quotation marks, for example, ("Sleep and Memory"). Avoid using URLs in the in-text citation. Practical scenario: You paraphrase a statistic from a government web page with no listed author. Use a short title in parentheses and make sure the Works Cited entry clearly matches that title. If the page has section headings and you quote a specific part, you can also integrate the heading into your signal phrase, but keep the parenthetical citation simple.
