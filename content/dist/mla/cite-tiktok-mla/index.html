<h2 >How to Cite a TikTok in MLA 9</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a TikTok post is usually treated as a short work published on a digital platform. Your goal is to help a reader find the exact video you used, and to give proper credit to the creator. MLA citations do this by presenting key details in a consistent order, so sources are easy to scan in a Works Cited list.</p>
<p>A typical MLA 9 Works Cited entry for TikTok includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creator’s name</strong> (the author)</li>
<li><strong>Title of the video</strong> (often taken from the caption, or a short description if there is no clear title)</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> (TikTok)</li>
<li><strong>Date posted</strong></li>
<li><strong>URL</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may also include an <strong>access date</strong> if the content is likely to change, disappear, or if your instructor prefers it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-tiktok-format-works-cited">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 TikTok Format (Works Cited)</h2>
<h3 id="basic-template">Basic template</h3>
<p><strong>Author Last, First Middle. “Title of Video.” <em>TikTok</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>If there is no clear video title, MLA allows you to use the caption or a brief description in quotation marks. Keep it short but specific.</p>
<h3 id="why-mla-uses-this-order">Why MLA uses this order</h3>
<p>MLA’s order is designed for quick identification. The author comes first so your Works Cited list can be alphabetized. The title comes next so the reader can confirm they have found the correct post. The platform, date, and URL help the reader locate the exact content.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-based-on-your-requirements">
<h2 >Author Rules You Must Follow (Based on Your Requirements)</h2>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>Use the creator’s <strong>full first name</strong>, not initials. This improves clarity and avoids confusion between people with similar names.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-is-inverted">First author is inverted</h3>
<p>The <strong>first author must be inverted</strong> in the Works Cited entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> Lopez, Maria Elena.  </li>
<li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Maria Elena Lopez.</li>
</ul>
<p>This inversion supports alphabetizing and is a standard MLA convention.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>If a TikTok post is credited to two creators, list them like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First author inverted</li>
<li>Second author in normal order</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
<strong>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</strong></p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>If three or more creators are credited, list only the first author (inverted) followed by <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the other names before et al.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
<strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<h3 id="no-author">No author</h3>
<p>If no author is available, start with the <strong>title</strong> in quotation marks. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” MLA expects you to begin with the title when the author is unknown.</p>
<p>For alphabetization, ignore <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, and <strong>The</strong> when sorting, but still keep them in the title if they appear.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-on-tiktok-what-counts-as-the-title">
<h2 >Titles on TikTok, What Counts as the “Title”</h2>
<p>TikTok videos often do not have formal titles. In MLA, you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>caption text</strong> as the title, if it works as a clear label.</li>
<li>A <strong>short description you create</strong>, if the caption is missing or not useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the title in <strong>quotation marks</strong> because the video is a short work.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If the caption is very long, shorten it to the first meaningful phrase. Keep the wording as close to the original as possible, and do not change the meaning.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-urls-and-access-dates">
<h2 >Dates, URLs, and Access Dates</h2>
<h3 id="date-format">Date format</h3>
<p>MLA uses: <strong>Day Month Year</strong><br />
Example: <strong>14 Oct. 2024</strong></p>
<p>Use the date TikTok shows as the posting date. If TikTok only displays a year or a relative time, use the most complete date you can verify. If you cannot find a date at all, you can omit it, but it is better to locate it when possible.</p>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>Use the direct URL to the TikTok video. Remove tracking parameters if they are obviously extra, but keep the link functional.</p>
<h3 id="access-date-optional-but-often-helpful">Access date (optional but often helpful)</h3>
<p>TikTok content can be deleted or made private. An access date can help document when you viewed it.</p>
<p>Add it at the end:<br />
<strong>Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>Ask your instructor if they want access dates for all web sources. If they do, apply it consistently.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author first and inverted:</strong> Lopez, Maria Elena.</li>
<li><strong>Title in quotation marks:</strong> The caption works as a clear title and identifies the specific video.</li>
<li><strong>Platform italicized:</strong> <em>TikTok</em> is the container, so it is italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Date included in MLA format:</strong> 14 Oct. 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Direct URL:</strong> Points to the exact video.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the account name is not the creator’s real name, MLA still prefers the name as presented by the creator. If you can identify the full name reliably from the profile, use it. If not, use the name shown on the account, but still follow the inversion rule.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors use “and”:</strong> Nguyen, Hannah Mai, and Jordan Alexander Reed.</li>

<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not invert both names. This is a frequent error because students assume all names should be reversed. MLA only inverts the first author in the entry.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author, so the title leads:</strong> MLA uses the title as the first element when the author is unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Title is in quotation marks:</strong> It is a short work.</li>

<li><strong>Access date included:</strong> Useful for content that may be removed or changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the title begins with “The,” “A,” or “An,” you still write it that way, but alphabetize it by the next word in your Works Cited list.</p>

<h2 >Why These Rules Matter</h2>
<p>These rules are not just formatting. They support three important academic goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crediting creators clearly.</strong> Using full first names and consistent author formatting reduces confusion and respects identity.</li>
<li><strong>Helping readers find the exact video.</strong> TikTok has many similar posts. The title, date, and URL work together to identify the right one.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping your Works Cited easy to use.</strong> Inverting the first author and using consistent patterns makes the list scannable and properly alphabetized.</li>

<h3 id="pitfall-2-forgetting-quotation-marks-around-the-video-title">Pitfall 2, Forgetting quotation marks around the video title</h3>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-for-building-a-strong-tiktok-citation">
<h2 >Practical Tips for Building a Strong TikTok Citation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decide what you will use as the title</strong> before you start formatting. Use the caption if it is clear, otherwise write a short description.</li>
<li><strong>Capture details immediately.</strong> Save the URL and date when you find the video, because TikTok content can disappear.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> If you include access dates for one TikTok citation, do the same for all similar web based sources unless your instructor says otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Double check name order.</strong> First author inverted, second author normal order, and three or more authors use et al.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, paste a TikTok link and the creator name shown on the account, and I can format the exact MLA 9 Works Cited entry using your rules.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Tiktok citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-tiktok-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes TikTok citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>TikTok posts look simple, but they combine several elements that create citation edge cases, like usernames versus real names, reposts, stitched content, changing captions, and links that may not open the same way for every reader. MLA 9 is flexible, but it still expects you to identify the creator, name the specific post, name the platform, and provide a stable way to find it again.</p>
<p>Your author rules matter here because TikTok often pushes you toward handles and partial names. In a Works Cited entry, the author position controls alphabetizing and helps readers scan your list quickly. Using full first names when you can also reduces confusion between similar accounts.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-9-template-for-a-tiktok-post">
<h2 >The basic MLA 9 template for a TikTok post</h2>
<p>A common MLA 9 approach for a TikTok video is:</p>
<p><strong>Author Last, First Middle. "Video description or title." <em>TikTok</em>, uploaded by Account Name (if different), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>In practice, TikTok posts rarely have formal titles, so you usually use the caption as the title in quotation marks. If the caption is long, you can shorten it, but keep the beginning the same as what appears on TikTok.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-username-display-name-and-full-first-name-conflicts">
<h2 >Special case: Username, display name, and full first name conflicts</h2>
<h3 id="when-you-know-the-creators-real-name">When you know the creator’s real name</h3>
<p>If a credible source confirms the creator’s real name, MLA allows you to use it as the author. This is often the clearest option, especially for public figures. TikTok also shows a display name and a handle, and either can differ from the person’s real name.</p>
<p><strong>Practical approach</strong><br />
- Use the real name as the author when you can verify it.<br />
- Include the TikTok handle in the title or in a description only if it helps identification, but do not replace the author’s name with the handle if the real name is known and reliable.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-only-have-a-handle">When you only have a handle</h3>
<p>Many creators do not share a real name. In that case, treat the handle as the author. Your rule about full first names is important, but it cannot be forced when the information does not exist. Do not invent a first name. Use the handle exactly as it appears.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>Author identification is the main way a reader checks credibility and finds the same account again. Using a real name when verified respects identity and reduces ambiguity. Using a handle when that is all you have avoids guesswork and keeps the citation honest.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-no-author-at-all">
<h2 >Special case: No author at all</h2>
<p>Sometimes a TikTok is posted by an organization account with no clear personal name, or the post is embedded elsewhere without clear attribution. If you truly cannot identify an author, MLA says to start with the <strong>title</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key rule</strong><br />
- Start with the title in quotation marks.<br />
- Do not use “Anonymous.”<br />
- Do not use “n.d.”<br />
- Alphabetize by the first significant word in the title, ignoring A, An, The.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-two-authors-and-group-content">
<h2 >Special case: Two authors and group content</h2>
<p>TikTok posts can be co-created, for example through collaboration features, joint accounts, or credited creators in the caption. If there are clearly two authors responsible for the post and both are credited as creators, follow your two-author rule.</p>
<p><strong>Two authors format</strong><br />
- First author inverted.<br />
- Second author in normal order.<br />
- Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</p>
<p>If there are three or more credited creators, use your rule:</p>
<p><strong>Three or more authors</strong><br />
- First author inverted.<br />
- Add <strong>et al.</strong><br />
- Do not list the rest.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
<p>These rules keep your Works Cited readable and consistent. They also prevent you from overloading the entry with a long list of handles that may not even be stable over time.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-reposts-stitches-duets-and-reactions">
<h2 >Special case: Reposts, stitches, duets, and reactions</h2>
<p>TikTok content often includes someone else’s video inside a new post. This creates a common question, who is the author?</p>
<h3 id="cite-the-version-you-actually-used">Cite the version you actually used</h3>
<p>If you watched a stitched or dueted video posted by Creator B, then Creator B’s post is your source. The author is Creator B. In your discussion, you can still mention that the post incorporates Creator A.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-need-to-cite-both">When you need to cite both</h3>
<p>If your argument depends on the original video and the stitched response, cite both videos separately. This is common in media analysis, where the relationship between the two posts matters.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>In your prose, clarify the relationship, for example: “In a stitch responding to [original creator], [stitch creator] argues that…”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-captions-that-change-and-missing-titles">
<h2 >Special case: Captions that change, and missing titles</h2>
<p>TikTok captions can be edited, and sometimes the caption is just emojis or a few generic words. MLA expects a title element, but you can handle this in a reader-friendly way.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong><br />
- Use the caption as the title if it is meaningful.<br />
- If the caption is not meaningful, create a brief descriptive title in plain language, still in quotation marks, and base it on what the video shows. Keep it neutral and accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters</strong><br />
The title is often what helps a reader confirm they found the right post. A vague title like “lol” is not helpful, so a short description can be more useful.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-dates-time-zones-and-uncertainty">
<h2 >Special case: Dates, time zones, and uncertainty</h2>
<p>TikTok shows dates in different formats depending on region and device settings, and older posts may show only a year or relative time in some contexts.</p>
<p><strong>MLA guidance</strong><br />
- Use the most specific date you can find.<br />
- If you cannot find a day and month, use the year you can verify.<br />
- Do not add a date you cannot confirm.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
Open the post in a browser when possible, not only in-app, since the browser view often provides clearer metadata.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-urls-redirects-and-access-problems">
<h2 >Special case: URLs, redirects, and access problems</h2>
<p>TikTok links can be long, may redirect, and may not open for readers without the app. MLA prefers a direct URL that leads to the item.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong><br />
- Use the share link that opens the specific video page.<br />
- If the URL is extremely long, MLA allows you to shorten it when it remains functional, but do not remove parts that break the link.<br />
- Include an <strong>Accessed</strong> date if the content is likely to change, be deleted, or be shown differently by location.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Copying a link that points to a general profile instead of the specific video. Always check that your link opens the exact post.</p>

- The title is the caption in quotation marks. It is treated like a short work.<br />
- <em>TikTok</em> is italicized as the container.<br />
- The date and URL help the reader retrieve the exact post.<br />
- The access date is included because TikTok content can be edited, removed, or shown differently.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Using only the handle as the author when the real name is known and verifiable. If you can confirm the full name, it usually improves clarity.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-on-a-clearly-co-created-post">
<h2 >Example 2: Two authors on a clearly co-created post</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Martinez, Sofia Elena and Jordan Lee. "How to negotiate rent, scripts that work." <em>TikTok</em>, 2 Feb. 2025, https://www.tiktok.com/@sofiaandjordan/video/7350000000000000000. Accessed 5 Feb. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- Two authors are listed, with the first inverted and the second in normal order.<br />
- The word <strong>and</strong> connects the names.<br />
- The rest of the citation follows the TikTok container pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Inverting both names. In MLA, only the first author is inverted in the Works Cited entry.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-caption-is-not-useful-descriptive-title-used">
<h2 >Example 3: No author, caption is not useful, descriptive title used</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
"Timelapse of a mural being painted on a brick wall." <em>TikTok</em>, 9 June 2023, https://www.tiktok.com/video/7200000000000000000. Accessed 12 Aug. 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- No author is available, so the entry starts with the title.<br />
- The title is descriptive and helps readers identify the content, which is better than a meaningless caption.<br />
- <em>TikTok</em> is the container.<br />
- The access date is included because posts can disappear or change.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Writing “Anonymous” or “n.d.” MLA does not require that, and it can mislead readers.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls checklist</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prefer a verified real name for the author when available, otherwise use the handle exactly as shown.</li>
<li>Use the caption as the title, but shorten long captions carefully, keeping the opening words.</li>
<li>Add an Accessed date for TikTok sources, especially for time-sensitive topics.</li>
<li>Double-check that your URL opens the exact post, not a profile or a search page.</li>
<li>If the post is a stitch or duet and your analysis focuses on the response, cite the response post. Cite the original too if it is central to your claim.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inventing a first name to satisfy a “full name” preference. Only use what you can verify.</li>
<li>Inverting the second author in a two-author citation.</li>
<li>Listing three or more authors without using <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>Using a vague title that does not help identification when the caption is uninformative.</li>
<li>Omitting the platform name. <em>TikTok</em> should appear as the container.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>MLA citations are not only formatting. They are a roadmap that lets a reader locate the same item you used, evaluate the creator, and understand the context. TikTok’s design encourages quick viewing and makes details easy to miss. Careful handling of authorship, titles, and retrieval information is what turns a fleeting post into a stable, checkable source in academic writing.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-tiktok-video-in-mla-9-for-my-works-cited-page">How do I cite a TikTok video in MLA 9 for my Works Cited page?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, cite a TikTok post like a social media entry. Start with the account holder’s name, if known, then the username in brackets. Put the full text of the post in quotation marks, or if it is long, use a short descriptive title you create. Then list TikTok in italics, the date of the post, the URL, and the access date if your instructor wants it or if the content is likely to change. Practical example, you are quoting a creator’s caption about study habits. Your entry should clearly identify the creator, the specific post, and where to find it. If the post has no meaningful caption, describe the video content in your title. For more guidance on MLA social media formatting, see the MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/ and Purdue OWL MLA Works Cited basics: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_basic_format.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-tiktok-video-has-no-real-title-or-the-caption-is-just-emojis-what-do-i-put-in-the-citation">What if the TikTok video has no real title or the caption is just emojis, what do I put in the citation?</h3>
<p>If the caption does not function as a usable title, MLA lets you supply a brief description in place of a title. Put your description in quotation marks, keep it concise, and describe what makes the video identifiable, for example, “Video explaining the Pomodoro method with on screen timer.” This is especially helpful when you are citing a clip used as evidence in an argument, like a demonstration of a trend or a claim about a product. Still include the creator name, the username in brackets, TikTok in italics, the posting date, and the URL. If the creator’s real name is unknown, start with the username. If you are unsure about when to invent a description versus using the full caption text, consult the MLA Style Center’s guidance on titles and social media posts: https://style.mla.org/titles/ and its general citation templates: https://style.mla.org/mla-format/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-an-in-text-citation-for-a-tiktok-video-in-mla">How do I do an in text citation for a TikTok video in MLA?</h3>
<p>For MLA in text citations, use the shortest element that clearly points to your Works Cited entry. TikTok posts usually do not have page numbers, so you typically cite the creator name or the username. If your Works Cited entry begins with a real name, cite that name in parentheses, for example, (Nguyen). If it begins with a username, cite the username, for example, (@studywithmira). Practical scenario, you paraphrase a creator’s explanation of a budgeting method and then analyze it, your in text citation should appear at the end of the sentence containing the borrowed idea. If you mention the creator in your sentence, you can omit the parenthetical. MLA in text rules are summarized here: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_in_text_citations_the_basics.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-cite-the-tiktok-creators-real-name-or-their-username-and-what-if-i-only-know-one-of-them">Do I cite the TikTok creator’s real name or their username, and what if I only know one of them?</h3>
<p>Use whichever name best identifies the creator, and follow MLA’s common approach for social media, list the real name first if you can confirm it, then put the username in brackets. If you only know the username, start with it. This matters when you have multiple posts from the same platform and you want your reader to find the exact source quickly. Practical scenario, you cite two different TikTok accounts that both post about the same news event. Including usernames helps distinguish them even if display names are similar. If the creator’s name appears inconsistent across posts, prefer the username because it is stable and searchable. For detailed guidance on author names and container formatting in MLA, see the MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/ and the MLA Works Cited core elements overview: https://style.mla.org/core-elements/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-include-the-date-i-watched-the-tiktok-and-what-if-the-video-gets-deleted-later">Should I include the date I watched the TikTok, and what if the video gets deleted later?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but many instructors prefer them for online sources that can change or disappear, including TikTok. If the post could be removed, edited, or made private, adding an access date is a practical safeguard. Practical scenario, you cite a TikTok used as evidence of a marketing claim, then the creator deletes it after criticism. An access date shows when you consulted it, and it supports your research timeline. If possible, also save a screenshot, note the video ID from the URL, or use an institutional archive if allowed by your course. Still cite the original URL and posting date if available. For MLA guidance on when to include access dates, consult the MLA Style Center’s date and online source discussions: https://style.mla.org/dates/ and general MLA format help: https://style.mla.org/mla-format/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-tiktok-that-i-found-reposted-on-another-site-or-a-tiktok-sound-or-duet">How do I cite a TikTok that I found reposted on another site, or a TikTok sound or duet?</h3>
<p>Cite the version you actually consulted, while making the relationship clear. If you watched the TikTok on TikTok, cite TikTok as the container. If you watched it embedded on a news site or blog, you can cite the page where you found it, and name TikTok as the original platform in your description if relevant. Practical scenario, you analyze a duet where one creator responds to another. Cite the duet post you viewed, and in your prose identify the original creator being responded to. For a sound, you usually cite the TikTok post that uses the sound, unless you are discussing the sound as a standalone item and can link to its sound page. MLA’s container concept is useful here, see the MLA Style Center on containers: https://style.mla.org/containers/ and Purdue OWL on MLA Works Cited entries: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_basic_format.html</p>
