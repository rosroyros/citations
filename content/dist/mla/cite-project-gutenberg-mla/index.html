<section class="content-section" id="what-project-gutenberg-is-and-why-it-needs-special-citation-care">
<h2 >What Project Gutenberg Is and Why It Needs Special Citation Care</h2>
<p>Project Gutenberg is a free digital library that hosts public domain books and other texts. When you use a Project Gutenberg ebook in a paper, you are usually citing a digital version of an older print work. That matters in MLA 9 because MLA asks you to identify the version you actually used, not just the original work.</p>
<p>A good Project Gutenberg citation helps your reader answer three simple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What work did you use, and who wrote it?</li>
<li>What version did you consult, and where did it come from?</li>
<li>How can someone else find the same text again?</li>
</ol>
<p>Because Project Gutenberg items can appear in several formats (HTML, EPUB, Kindle, plain text), and because the site sometimes lists editors, translators, or release information, careful formatting keeps your Works Cited entry clear and consistent.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="mla-9-core-elements-applied-to-project-gutenberg">
<h2 >MLA 9 Core Elements Applied to Project Gutenberg</h2>
<p>MLA 9 citations are built from “core elements” in a standard order. For Project Gutenberg, you will most often use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong> (the original author of the book)</li>
<li><strong>Title of source</strong> (the book title)</li>
<li><strong>Title of container</strong> (Project Gutenberg)</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong> (optional, only if it helps, such as “EPUB” or a specific edition statement)</li>
<li><strong>Number</strong> (optional, often the ebook number)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> (Project Gutenberg typically functions as the website publisher, often listed as “Project Gutenberg”)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong> (often the ebook release date on the Gutenberg record page)</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> (the URL)</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA 9 is flexible, so you do not need to force every element into every citation. Include what is useful and available, and prioritize what helps retrieval.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-based-on-your-requirements">
<h2 >Author Rules You Must Follow (Based on Your Requirements)</h2>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>Use the author’s full first name whenever it is known and commonly available. This improves clarity and helps distinguish authors with similar names. For example, use <strong>“Austen, Jane”</strong> rather than <strong>“Austen, J.”</strong></p>
<h3 id="first-author-is-always-inverted">First author is always inverted</h3>
<p>The first author in the Works Cited entry must be inverted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last, First Middle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This supports alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-name-is-not-inverted">Two authors use “and,” second name is not inverted</h3>
<p>Format:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First author inverted</strong>, then <strong>and</strong>, then <strong>Second author normal order</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last, First Middle, and First Last.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Three or more authors use “et al.”</h3>
<p>List only the first author (inverted, full first name), then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list additional authors before et al.</p>
<p>Pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last, First Middle, et al.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p>If no author is given, start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” Also remember that alphabetization ignores initial articles like A, An, and The, even though you still write them in the citation.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="basic-project-gutenberg-works-cited-format">
<h2 >Basic Project Gutenberg Works Cited Format</h2>
<p>In many cases, this format works well:</p>
<p><strong>Author Last, Author First. <em>Title of Book</em>. Project Gutenberg, Publication Date, URL.</strong></p>
<p>Notes:<br />
- Italicize the <strong>book title</strong>.<br />
- Italicize the <strong>website name</strong> (Project Gutenberg) because it is the container.<br />
- Use the <strong>stable URL</strong> from the book’s main Gutenberg page when possible.<br />
- MLA prefers URLs without “https://” if your instructor allows, but MLA 9 also accepts full URLs. Consistency matters most.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-1-one-author-ebook-on-project-gutenberg">
<h2 >Example 1, One Author Ebook on Project Gutenberg</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Austen, Jane. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. Project Gutenberg, 1 June 1998, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: “Austen, Jane” uses the full first name, and the name is inverted.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: The book title is italicized because it is a complete work.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: “Project Gutenberg” is the website hosting the text you used.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: The date shown here reflects the Gutenberg release date, which is often the clearest publication date for the digital version.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: The ebook page URL is stable and helps readers retrieve the same item.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Project Gutenberg pages sometimes show multiple dates (release date, last updated date). Choose the date that best represents the version you used. Often that is the “Release Date” on the Gutenberg record.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-and-why-and-and-name-order-matter">
<h2 >Example 2, Two Authors (and Why “and” and Name Order Matter)</h2>
<p>Some Gutenberg texts, especially collections or coauthored works, can have two authors. Follow your two author rule exactly.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p>Besant, Walter, and James Rice. <em>The Golden Butterfly</em>. Project Gutenberg, 6 Oct. 2004, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13675.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First author inverted</strong>: “Besant, Walter” is last name first.</li>
<li><strong>Second author not inverted</strong>: “James Rice” stays in normal order.</li>
<li><strong>“and” used</strong>: MLA uses “and” between two authors. This is clearer than symbols like “&amp;,” and it matches formal academic style.</li>
<li><strong>Everything else follows the same Gutenberg pattern</strong>: title in italics, container, date, URL.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not invert the second author. Writing “Besant, Walter, and Rice, James” is not correct under your rules.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-listed-on-the-gutenberg-item">
<h2 >Example 3, No Author Listed on the Gutenberg Item</h2>
<p>Sometimes a Gutenberg page is for a work with no clear author (for example, a folk collection, an anonymous pamphlet, or a document where authorship is not provided). In that case, start with the title.</p>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry-correct-formatting">Works Cited entry (correct formatting)</h3>
<p><em>The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America</em>. Project Gutenberg, 1 Aug. 1991, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: The citation begins with the title.</li>
<li><strong>Title formatting</strong>: It is italicized because it is treated as a standalone work on the site.</li>
<li><strong>No filler labels</strong>: You do not add “Anonymous” or “n.d.” because MLA does not require that, and it can mislead readers.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval details included</strong>: Project Gutenberg and the URL identify exactly where you found the text.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the Gutenberg record page lists an organization as an author (for example, a government body), you can often treat that organization as the author. If it truly lists no author, start with the title.</p>
</section>

<h2 >Why These Rules Matter (Beyond “Because MLA Says So”)</h2>
<h3 id="they-improve-readability-and-trust">They improve readability and trust</h3>
<p>Full first names and consistent author formatting help readers quickly recognize who wrote the work. This is especially useful with classic texts that have many editions and versions online.</p>
<h3 id="they-support-accurate-alphabetizing">They support accurate alphabetizing</h3>
<p>Inverting the first author’s name makes Works Cited lists easier to scan. It also prevents confusion when multiple authors share last names.</p>
<h3 id="they-help-readers-locate-the-same-version">They help readers locate the same version</h3>
<p>Project Gutenberg texts can differ slightly by format or by updates. Including the container (Project Gutenberg), a relevant date, and a stable URL makes it easier for someone to find what you used.</p>
<h3 id="they-prevent-accidental-misattribution">They prevent accidental misattribution</h3>
<p>Using “Anonymous” or guessing at missing information can create incorrect claims about authorship. MLA’s approach avoids that by citing what is actually provided.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-when-citing-project-gutenberg">
<h2 >Common Pitfalls When Citing Project Gutenberg</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Citing the original print date as if it were the version you used.</strong> If you read it on Gutenberg, the digital publication details usually matter more for retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Using the wrong page URL.</strong> Use the main ebook page (often /ebooks/####) rather than a long URL for a specific file format, unless your instructor asks for the exact file.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting italics.</strong> Book titles and the website container should be italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing up author rules.</strong> Do not use initials, do not invert the second author in two author works, and use et al. for three or more authors.</li>
<li><strong>Adding “n.d.”</strong> MLA 9 does not require “n.d.” If no date is available, you can omit it.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-checklist-before-you-submit">
<h2 >Quick Checklist Before You Submit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Author full first name used, not initials.</li>
<li>First author inverted, always.</li>
<li>Two authors use “and,” second author not inverted.</li>
<li>Three or more authors use “et al.” after the first author only.</li>
<li>If no author, start with the title, no “Anonymous,” no “n.d.”</li>
<li>Title italicized, Project Gutenberg italicized.</li>
<li>Date and stable URL included when available.</li>
<li>Punctuation is consistent, and the entry ends with a period.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Project Gutenberg citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-project-gutenberg-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes Project Gutenberg citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Project Gutenberg is not a traditional publisher in the usual sense. It is a digital library that hosts public domain texts, often created from scans or transcriptions of older editions. Because of that, the information you see on a Gutenberg page can mix together:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original author and original publication era</li>
<li>A specific edition or translation that Gutenberg digitized</li>
<li>The people who produced the digital file (transcribers, proofreaders, “Produced by” credits)</li>
<li>Multiple formats, such as HTML, EPUB, Kindle, plain text</li>
<li>A stable “ebook number” page that acts like a container record</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA 9 can handle all of these, but you need to make careful choices about which details matter for your purpose. The main goal is to help your reader locate the exact version you used, and to give proper credit to the author and, when relevant, the translator or editor.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-mla-9-approach-for-project-gutenberg">
<h2 >The core MLA 9 approach for Project Gutenberg</h2>
<p>In most cases, treat Project Gutenberg as the website (the container), and the text as the work. A common Works Cited structure looks like this:</p>
<p>Author. <em>Title of Book</em>. Project Gutenberg, Year of posting (if shown), URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<p>Two important notes for Gutenberg:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the author of the work as the author of the entry</strong>, not the transcriber or “Produced by” credits. Those credits are usually not treated as authors in MLA.</li>
<li><strong>Use the version you actually read</strong>, and make it findable. The safest URL is usually the main ebook landing page (the one with the ebook number), not a temporary file link.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-multiple-possible-dates-which-one-should-you-use">
<h2 >Special case 1, multiple possible dates, which one should you use</h2>
<p>Gutenberg pages often show several dates, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Release Date” or “Posting Date” on Project Gutenberg</li>
<li>A date inside the book itself, such as an 1851 publication date</li>
<li>Sometimes a “Last Updated” date</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-mla-9">What to do in MLA 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are citing the <strong>Gutenberg digital edition as the version you consulted</strong>, use the <strong>Gutenberg posting or release year</strong> as the publication date in the Works Cited entry.</li>
<li>If your discussion depends on the <strong>historical publication context</strong>, you can mention the original publication year in your prose, but do not force it into the Works Cited date slot if it is not the publication date of the version you used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Readers need to find the same text you used. Gutenberg’s posting year helps identify the digital version. The original year can still be important, but it serves a different purpose, historical context rather than retrieval.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-you-used-a-specific-file-format-html-vs-epub-vs-kindle">
<h2 >Special case 2, you used a specific file format, HTML vs EPUB vs Kindle</h2>
<p>Project Gutenberg offers the same text in multiple formats. Sometimes the formatting changes, page breaks differ, and chapter numbering can vary.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-mla-9">What to do in MLA 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cite the <strong>work</strong> and the <strong>Project Gutenberg container</strong>, then use the <strong>ebook landing page URL</strong> when possible.</li>
<li>If the format matters to your argument, add a brief description at the end, such as “EPUB file” or “Kindle file,” as an optional detail.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you used the HTML reader in your browser, the landing page is still usually the best link because it is stable and gives access to all formats.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-produced-by-credits-proofreaders-and-transcribers">
<h2 >Special case 3, “Produced by” credits, proofreaders, and transcribers</h2>
<p>Many Gutenberg texts include lines like “Produced by Jane Doe and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.” These people contributed to the digital file, but MLA usually does not treat them as the primary author.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-mla-9">What to do in MLA 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not put “Produced by” names in the author position.</li>
<li>If you have a reason to credit them, you can mention them in your prose or include a note, but it is not required for most student research writing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>MLA’s author slot is for the creator of the intellectual content. Gutenberg production credits are closer to technical contributors, unless the person is clearly an editor or translator whose work you are using.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-editors-and-translators-when-they-should-appear">
<h2 >Special case 4, editors and translators, when they should appear</h2>
<p>Some Gutenberg items are translations, or they are editions with an editor named prominently.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-mla-9">What to do in MLA 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you used a translated work, include the translator because translation shapes the text you read.</li>
<li>If the text is an edited edition and the editor is clearly responsible for the version, include the editor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Your reader may find multiple translations of the same classic work. Listing the translator helps your reader locate your version and understand differences in wording.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-corporate-author-vs-no-author">
<h2 >Special case 5, corporate author vs no author</h2>
<p>Most Gutenberg books have an author, but some items are collections, reference works, or documents where no individual author is given.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-mla-9">What to do in MLA 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>If there is <strong>no author</strong>, start with the title.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous” and do not insert “n.d.”</li>
<li>If a group truly authored the work, you can use that group as author, but do not confuse the host site with the author. Project Gutenberg is usually the container, not the author of the text.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>Starting with the title keeps your Works Cited accurate and alphabetizable. It also avoids attributing authorship to the wrong entity.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-6-stable-urls-ebook-number-pages-vs-direct-file-links">
<h2 >Special case 6, stable URLs, ebook number pages vs direct file links</h2>
<p>Gutenberg provides many links, including direct links to text files that can change.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Best practice</h3>
<p>Use the ebook landing page, for example:<br />
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342</p>
<p>This is more stable than a link that ends in “.txt” or “.html” with extra path details.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Copying the URL from your browser bar while reading the HTML version might produce a long link that is less stable. The landing page is usually safer.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="special-case-7-citing-a-chapter-poem-or-section-within-a-gutenberg-book">
<h2 >Special case 7, citing a chapter, poem, or section within a Gutenberg book</h2>
<p>Sometimes you quote only one chapter or a specific poem inside a larger collection.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-in-mla-9">What to do in MLA 9</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the part has its own title, you can cite the part in quotation marks, then the book title in italics as the container.</li>
<li>If the part does not have a title, cite the book and identify the chapter or section in your in-text citation, for example by chapter number.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Because Gutenberg texts often lack stable page numbers, favor <strong>chapter numbers</strong> or other internal divisions for in-text citations.</p>

Austen, Jane. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. Project Gutenberg, 1 June 1998, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author is the original author, “Austen, Jane,” with the first author inverted.<br />
- The title is italicized because it is a complete book.<br />
- “Project Gutenberg” is the container, the website hosting the text.<br />
- The date shown on Gutenberg is used as the version’s posting date.<br />
- The landing page URL is stable and easy for readers to use.<br />
- The access date is helpful because online texts can be updated or reformatted.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Do not list “Project Gutenberg” as the author. It hosts the text but did not write it.</p>

<h2 >Example 2, translated work, translator matters</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Dante Alighieri. <em>The Divine Comedy</em>. Translated by Henry Francis Cary, Project Gutenberg, 1 May 2001, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author is the creator of the original work.<br />
- The translator is included because the English wording you quote comes from Henry Francis Cary.<br />
- The container is Project Gutenberg, and the date reflects the digital posting.<br />
- This prevents confusion if another translation is used elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Do not treat the translator as the author. In MLA, the author stays in the author position, and the translator is introduced with “Translated by.”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-start-with-the-title">
<h2 >Example 3, no author, start with the title</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
<em>The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America</em>. Project Gutenberg, 1 Aug. 1991, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- No individual author is listed, so the title moves to the first position.<br />
- The title is italicized because it is a standalone document presented as a complete work on the site.<br />
- You avoid adding “Anonymous” or “n.d.,” both of which MLA discourages.<br />
- The entry still gives a clear path to the exact Gutenberg record.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
Do not alphabetize under “The.” MLA ignores initial articles for alphabetization, even though you still write the title normally in the entry.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>ebook landing page</strong> URL whenever possible.</li>
<li>Prefer <strong>chapter numbers</strong> or section names for in-text citations when page numbers are missing.</li>
<li>Include a <strong>translator</strong> when you quote a translated text.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Gutenberg posting date</strong> to identify the digital version, and discuss original publication dates in your writing if relevant.</li>

<h2 >Common pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Listing “Produced by” credits as authors.</li>
<li>Using a long, unstable direct file URL instead of the ebook page.</li>
<li>Mixing up the original publication year with the Gutenberg posting year in a way that makes the version hard to find.</li>
<li>Omitting the translator when translation is central to the text you are quoting.</li>
<li>Using initials for authors. Your rule requires full first names, and it also improves clarity for readers.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-for-your-reader">
<h2 >Why these rules matter for your reader</h2>
<p>MLA citations are not just formalities. They are directions. With Project Gutenberg, the same classic work can appear in multiple translations, editions, and formats. Following consistent rules, especially correct author placement, stable links, and meaningful contributor roles, helps your reader locate the exact text you used and understand what version shaped your quotation and interpretation.</p>
<p>If you tell me which Gutenberg page you are using, and whether you read HTML, EPUB, or Kindle, I can format a Works Cited entry that matches your exact source and your instructor’s expectations.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-project-gutenberg-ebook-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Project Gutenberg eBook in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, cite the version you actually used on Project Gutenberg. Start with the author. Then give the title of the book in italics, followed by the website name, Project Gutenberg, the publication date listed on the Gutenberg page (often the “Release Date”), the URL, and the access date if your instructor requests it. Example scenario, you read Jane Austen on your phone using the web page. Your entry might look like: Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice. Project Gutenberg, 28 June 2008, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026. If the page lists an eBook number, you can include it at the end if helpful, but it is not required. For MLA basics, see the Purdue OWL MLA Works Cited guide: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_basic_format.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-date-should-i-use-when-citing-project-gutenberg-original-publication-date-or-the-gutenberg-release-date">What date should I use when citing Project Gutenberg, original publication date or the Gutenberg release date?</h3>
<p>Use the date that describes the version you consulted. For most Project Gutenberg items, the “Release Date” or “Last Updated” reflects the digital edition you accessed, so it is usually the best choice for the Works Cited entry. The original publication date can matter in your discussion, especially for historical context, but MLA citations typically describe the source you used. Practical scenario, you cite Dracula and the Gutenberg page shows a release date in 1995, while the novel was published in 1897. In your Works Cited, use the Gutenberg release date. In your essay, you can still mention that Stoker’s novel was published in 1897. If no date is clearly given, omit the date and focus on author, title, site, and URL, then include an access date if requested. For MLA guidance on dates and versions, see MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-cite-the-author-the-editor-or-project-gutenberg-as-the-publisher">Do I cite the author, the editor, or Project Gutenberg as the publisher?</h3>
<p>Usually, cite the author as the main creator, and list Project Gutenberg as the website or container, not as the author. Project Gutenberg is providing access, it is not the creator of the text. If the Gutenberg record credits an editor, translator, or illustrator and that contribution matters to your use, include the relevant contributor after the title using MLA roles, for example, “Translated by” or “Edited by.” Practical scenario, you are quoting a translated work and the Gutenberg page identifies the translator. You should credit the translator because the wording you quote comes from that translation. For most standard novels with no special credited editor, you can omit editors and just cite the author and title. If you are citing the specific HTML file, EPUB, or Kindle file, you can still treat Project Gutenberg as the container. For roles like editor and translator, see: https://style.mla.org/citing-translations/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-quotes-from-a-project-gutenberg-book-with-no-page-numbers">How do I do in-text citations for quotes from a Project Gutenberg book with no page numbers?</h3>
<p>If the text has no stable page numbers, MLA recommends using other locators. Use chapter numbers, book or part numbers, section headings, or paragraph numbers if they are clear and consistent. Practical scenario, you quote from an HTML version of a novel on Gutenberg that shows chapter headings but no page numbers. Your in-text citation can be (Author, ch. 3) or (Author, Chapter 3) depending on your style consistency. If you are quoting poetry, use line numbers if the lines are numbered, or cite the division and line range if available. If no reliable locator exists, you can cite only the author in parentheses and integrate the location into your sentence, for example, “In Chapter 3, Stoker describes…” Instructors vary on preferences, so check your course policy. For MLA in-text citation options, see: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-cite-the-project-gutenberg-web-page-the-epub-file-or-the-kindle-file-i-downloaded">Should I cite the Project Gutenberg web page, the EPUB file, or the Kindle file I downloaded?</h3>
<p>Cite the format and version you actually used, because details like file type and layout can affect how you accessed the text. If you read the HTML web page, cite the web page URL. If you downloaded an EPUB and read it in an eReader app, you can cite the EPUB as a digital file, while still naming Project Gutenberg as the source that provided it. Practical scenario, you downloaded the EPUB, imported it to Apple Books, and used search and highlights there. Your citation should reflect that you used an EPUB file from Project Gutenberg, and you can include the URL to the main eBook record because it is stable. If your instructor wants a direct file link, you can include it, but the record page is usually easier for readers to find. For MLA guidance on citing digital files, see: https://style.mla.org/citing-digital-files/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-project-gutenberg-book-with-multiple-authors-a-corporate-author-or-no-listed-author">How do I cite a Project Gutenberg book with multiple authors, a corporate author, or no listed author?</h3>
<p>For multiple authors, list them in the order shown on the Gutenberg record. In MLA, two authors are listed in the same entry, and three or more can be shortened after the first author with “et al.” Practical scenario, you cite a collection credited to three compilers, you can write “First Author et al.” If the work has a corporate author, such as a government report hosted on Gutenberg, use the organization as the author. If no author is listed, start the Works Cited entry with the title in italics, then Project Gutenberg, date, and URL. In-text citations follow the same logic, use the author name, or a shortened title if there is no author. If the title is long, shorten it to a few key words.
