<h2 >How to Cite a Play in MLA 9 (Works Cited and In Text)</h2>
<p>Citing a play in MLA 9 depends on how you accessed it. A play can appear as a script in a book, as a play within an anthology, as an online text, or as a live performance you attended. MLA citations are built from “core elements” in a consistent order, but you only include the pieces that apply to your source.</p>
<p>Your rules about author names are especially important for plays because many plays are frequently republished, translated, edited, and collected. Using the correct name format and the right container information helps readers find the exact version you used.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-basic-mla-9-pattern-for-a-play-printed">
<h2 >The Basic MLA 9 Pattern for a Play (Printed)</h2>
<h3 id="most-common-case-a-play-in-a-book-a-single-play-published-as-a-book">Most common case, a play in a book (a single play published as a book)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited format:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author Last, First Middle. <em>Title of Play</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>This is the cleanest citation because the play itself is the whole book, so there is no larger container like an anthology.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-play-is-inside-a-collection-or-anthology">If the play is inside a collection or anthology</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited format:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author Last, First Middle. “Title of Play.” <em>Title of Collection</em>, edited by Editor First Last, Publisher, Year, pp. page range.</strong></p>
<p>Here, the collection is the container, and the play is one item inside it.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-your-required-formatting">
<h2 >Author Rules (Your Required Formatting)</h2>
<h3 id="one-author">One author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use the author’s full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>Invert the first author’s name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Last, First Middle.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>Shakespeare, William.</strong></p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted.</li>
<li>Second author is normal order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<ul>
<li>List only the first author (inverted, full first name).</li>
<li>Then add <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>Do not list additional authors before et al.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Last, First Middle, et al.</p>
<h3 id="no-author">No author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the title.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</li>
<li>For alphabetizing, ignore A, An, The, but keep them in the citation itself.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="in-text-citations-for-plays-how-they-work">
<h2 >In Text Citations for Plays (How They Work)</h2>
<p>In text citations for plays usually include the author’s last name, plus a locator. The locator depends on what you have available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page numbers</strong> if you used a printed script or a PDF with stable page numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Act, scene, and line numbers</strong> if your edition provides them, which is common for classic plays.</li>
<li><strong>Act and scene</strong> if line numbers are not available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-in-text-formats">Common in text formats</h3>
<ul>
<li>With page number: <strong>(Shakespeare 57)</strong></li>
<li>With act, scene, lines: <strong>(Shakespeare 1.3.55-57)</strong></li>
<li>With act and scene only: <strong>(Sophocles 2.1)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use what your version provides, and stay consistent.</p>

<h2 >Example 1, A Play Published as a Book (Single Author)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry">Works Cited entry</h3>
<p><strong>Miller, Arthur. <em>Death of a Salesman</em>. Penguin Books, 1998.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-this-formatting-is-correct">Why this formatting is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author name:</strong> Arthur Miller is listed as <strong>Miller, Arthur</strong>, which follows the required inversion for the first author and uses his full first name.</li>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> The title of the play is italicized because it is a complete work.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher and year:</strong> These identify the specific edition, which matters because different editions can have different introductions, pagination, and editorial notes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-examples">In text citation examples</h3>
<p>If you quote from page 82:<br />
- <strong>(Miller 82)</strong></p>
<p>If you mention Miller in the sentence:<br />
- Miller shows Willy’s confusion directly in his speech (82).</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If your book has an editor or an introduction author, you usually do not list them as the main author. The playwright remains the author. Editors typically appear only when the play is inside a collection or when the edition is strongly defined by an editor.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-2-a-play-inside-an-anthology-play-as-a-short-work-in-a-container">
<h2 >Example 2, A Play Inside an Anthology (Play as a Short Work in a Container)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry">Works Cited entry</h3>
<p><strong>Hansberry, Lorraine. “A Raisin in the Sun.” <em>The Norton Anthology of African American Literature</em>, edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Valerie Smith, W. W. Norton and Company, 2014, pp. 1498-1559.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-this-formatting-is-correct">Why this formatting is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play title in quotation marks:</strong> Because the play is an item within a larger book, it is treated like a work inside a container.</li>
<li><strong>Container title italicized:</strong> The anthology is the container, so it is italicized.</li>
<li><strong>Editors included:</strong> The anthology is defined by its editors, so MLA includes them after the container title.</li>
<li><strong>Page range included:</strong> This tells readers where the play appears in the anthology, and it helps them find your quoted passage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-examples">In text citation examples</h3>
<p>If you quote from page 1510 of the anthology:<br />
- <strong>(Hansberry 1510)</strong></p>
<p>If the anthology has stable act and scene numbering that your instructor prefers, you can use that instead, but page numbers are usually easiest for anthology citations.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not italicize the play title in this case. Many writers mistakenly italicize it because it is a play. In MLA, the key issue is whether the play is the whole source or part of a larger source. Part of a larger source usually means quotation marks.</p>

<li><strong>First author inverted:</strong> Fugard appears as <strong>Fugard, Athol</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Second author not inverted:</strong> John Kani appears as <strong>John Kani</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>“and” used:</strong> MLA uses “and” rather than an ampersand.</li>
<li><strong>Full first names:</strong> No initials are used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation-examples">In text citation examples</h3>
<p>If you quote from page 24:<br />
- <strong>(Fugard and Kani 24)</strong></p>
<p>If you name them in the sentence:<br />
- Fugard and Kani build tension through repetition (24).</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not write: <strong>Fugard, Athol, Kani, John.</strong> That incorrectly inverts the second author.</p>

<h3 id="they-help-readers-locate-the-exact-version">They help readers locate the exact version</h3>
<p>Plays often exist in many editions and formats. A reader needs to know which text you used, especially if page numbers differ across editions.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-and-common-mistakes-to-avoid">
<h2 >Practical Tips and Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decide what you are citing first:</strong> Is the play the whole source, or is it inside a collection? That choice changes italics versus quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Use the title page, not the cover:</strong> The title page usually gives the most reliable author, publisher, and year information.</li>
<li><strong>Match your in text locator to your source:</strong> Use page numbers if that is what your text provides. Use act, scene, and line numbers if those are clearly marked and stable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using initials for authors:</strong> Your rule requires full first names. Write <strong>William Shakespeare</strong>, not <strong>W. Shakespeare</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Inverting the second author in two author works:</strong> Only the first author is inverted.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the container for anthology plays:</strong> If the play is inside a larger book, include the anthology title, editors, and page range.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing locator systems:</strong> Do not cite one quote by page number and another by act and scene unless you have a clear reason and your instructor allows it.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Play Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="special-and-edge-cases-when-citing-plays-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Special and edge cases when citing plays in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing plays in MLA 9 is usually straightforward, but plays create frequent edge cases because they appear in many forms. You might read a printed script, watch a filmed performance, use a database, quote stage directions, or cite a specific line from a verse drama. The goal in MLA is consistency and traceability. Your reader should be able to find the exact version you used and locate the exact passage you quoted.</p>
<p>Your additional name rules matter here because plays often involve multiple contributors. A clear author entry helps your Works Cited stay alphabetized and prevents confusion between people with similar last names.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-idea-to-keep-in-mind">
<h2 >Core idea to keep in mind</h2>
<p>For a play, MLA usually asks you to cite:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong>, then <strong>title of the play</strong></li>
<li><strong>Container</strong> (the book, anthology, website, database, or streaming platform that contains the play or performance)</li>
<li><strong>Publication details</strong> (publisher, year, page range, URL, and so on)</li>
<li><strong>Location in the play</strong> for in-text citations (act, scene, line numbers, or page numbers)</li>
</ul>
<p>The edge cases mostly come from two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What exactly is your source</strong>, a script, an edition, an excerpt, or a performance?</li>
<li><strong>What is the most useful locator</strong>, page, act and scene, or line numbers?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-a-play-published-inside-an-anthology-or-collection">
<h2 >Special case 1: A play published inside an anthology or collection</h2>
<p>Many students cite the play as if it were a whole book, then forget the anthology. In MLA, the anthology is the container, so it must appear after the play title.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If you omit the anthology, a reader cannot easily locate your specific edition, page range, or editor. Different anthologies also use different line numbering and pagination.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-play-in-an-anthology-with-explanation">Example 1, play in an anthology (with explanation)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong></p>
<p>Shakespeare, William. <em>Hamlet</em>. <em>The Norton Shakespeare</em>, edited by Stephen Greenblatt et al., W. W. Norton and Company, 2016, pp. 1685-1775.</p>
<p><strong>What is happening in this citation:</strong><br />
- <strong>Author:</strong> Shakespeare, William, first author inverted and full first name used.<br />
- <strong>Title of play:</strong> <em>Hamlet</em> in italics because it is a complete work.<br />
- <strong>Container:</strong> <em>The Norton Shakespeare</em> in italics.<br />
- <strong>Other contributors:</strong> “edited by” plus the editor name. If there are three or more editors, you can use “et al.” after the first editor. This matches MLA practice for long contributor lists.<br />
- <strong>Publisher and year:</strong> W. W. Norton and Company, 2016.<br />
- <strong>Pages:</strong> pp. 1685-1775, because the play is part of a larger book.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation tips:</strong><br />
- If the edition provides <strong>act, scene, and line numbers</strong>, use them, for example: (Hamlet 1.3.55-57).<br />
- If it does not, use <strong>page numbers</strong> from your edition: (Shakespeare 1702).</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using only (Shakespeare) without a locator. Plays are long, so MLA expects a location, not just an author name.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-a-play-as-a-standalone-book-but-you-are-quoting-stage-directions">
<h2 >Special case 2: A play as a standalone book, but you are quoting stage directions</h2>
<p>Stage directions count as part of the text, but students often cite them incorrectly or try to treat them as a separate source.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Stage directions can be crucial evidence, especially for tone, movement, and implied meaning. Your citation should still lead the reader to the correct spot in the play.</p>
<h3 id="practical-guidance">Practical guidance</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your play uses <strong>line numbers</strong>, cite them even for stage directions.</li>
<li>If it uses <strong>page numbers</strong>, cite the page.</li>
<li>In your prose, you can clarify that you are quoting stage directions, but you do not need a special Works Cited format just for that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quoting stage directions without any locator.</li>
<li>Mixing different locator systems in one paper, for example sometimes page numbers, sometimes act and scene, without a reason. Pick the most stable system for your edition.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-citing-a-translated-play">
<h2 >Special case 3: Citing a translated play</h2>
<p>If you read a play in translation, the translator is essential because translations differ significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your quotations are the translator’s wording. Crediting the translator is part of accurate attribution, and it helps the reader find the same text.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-translated-play-with-explanation">Example 2, translated play (with explanation)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong></p>
<p>Ibsen, Henrik. <em>A Doll’s House</em>. Translated by Rolf Fjelde, Dover Publications, 1992.</p>
<p><strong>What is happening in this citation:</strong><br />
- <strong>Author:</strong> Ibsen, Henrik, inverted, full first name.<br />
- <strong>Title:</strong> <em>A Doll’s House</em> in italics.<br />
- <strong>Translator:</strong> “Translated by Rolf Fjelde” appears after the title because it is a key contributor.<br />
- <strong>Publisher and year:</strong> Dover Publications, 1992.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation tips:</strong><br />
- Use page numbers from your edition: (Ibsen 47).<br />
- If your edition includes act and line numbering, you may use that instead, but be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing the translator as the author. In MLA, the playwright remains the author, and the translator is added as a contributor unless your assignment specifically asks you to foreground the translator.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-a-play-accessed-in-a-database-or-on-a-website">
<h2 >Special case 4: A play accessed in a database or on a website</h2>
<p>Sometimes you read a script through a library database or a website that hosts the text. In MLA, the website or database becomes a container, and you usually include a URL or DOI.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Online versions can differ from print versions, and URLs help readers verify the exact source you used.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-include">What to include</h3>
<ul>
<li>Author and play title</li>
<li>Website or database name as the container</li>
<li>Publisher or sponsoring organization if available</li>
<li>Publication date if available</li>
<li>URL (without https:// is acceptable in MLA, but consistency matters)</li>
<li>Access date only if your instructor requires it, or if the content is likely to change</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li>Treating the website as the publisher and leaving out the container name.</li>
<li>Omitting the URL.</li>
<li>Using “n.d.” when no date is given. MLA generally prefers simply leaving the date out if it is not available.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-a-filmed-stage-performance-or-recorded-production">
<h2 >Special case 5: A filmed stage performance or recorded production</h2>
<p>A recorded performance is not the same as the script. If you are analyzing acting, staging, lighting, or directing choices, you should cite the performance.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A production can change emphasis, cut lines, or interpret characters differently. Your reader needs to know which production you mean.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-recorded-performance-with-explanation">Example 3, recorded performance (with explanation)</h3>

- <strong>Author and title:</strong> Still included, because it is Shakespeare’s play.<br />
- <strong>Key contributors:</strong> The director and principal performers are listed because you are citing a performance, not just the text.<br />
- <strong>Production company and year:</strong> Royal Shakespeare Company, 2009.<br />
- <strong>Container:</strong> <em>Digital Theatre Plus</em> as the streaming platform.<br />
- <strong>Location:</strong> URL for retrieval, and an access date because streaming catalogs and links can change.</p>
<p><strong>In-text citation tips:</strong><br />
- If you reference a specific moment, use a <strong>time stamp</strong> if your platform shows it, for example: (Shakespeare 00:42:18-00:43:05).<br />
- If there are no time stamps, describe the moment clearly in your sentence and cite the source in parentheses.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Citing the performance as if it were a book with page numbers. Performances need different locators, usually time stamps.</p>

<h2 >Special case 6: Two authors, three or more authors, and “no author” scenarios</h2>
<p>Most plays have one playwright, but modern works can have co-authors, devised theatre credits, or organizational authorship.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>Use both names, first author inverted, second author normal order, with “and” between.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- Last, First Middle, and First Last. <em>Title of Play</em>. Publisher, Year.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>Use first author inverted, then “et al.” Do not list the remaining authors.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- Last, First Middle, et al. <em>Title of Play</em>. Publisher, Year.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-listed">No author listed</h3>
<p>Start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” and do not use “n.d.” If no date is given, omit the date.</p>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- <em>Title of Play</em>. Publisher, Year.</p>
<p><strong>Why these rules matter:</strong> Your Works Cited list must alphabetize cleanly, and full first names reduce ambiguity. Using “et al.” prevents citations from becoming unreadable, especially when a production has many credited creators.</p>

<h2 >Practical tips for play citations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Match your in-text locator to your edition.</strong> If your book provides line numbers, use them. If it does not, use page numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent across the paper.</strong> Do not switch between page numbers and act.scene.line unless you explain why.</li>
<li><strong>Cite the version you actually used.</strong> If you watched a performance, cite the performance. If you read a PDF from a database, cite that container.</li>
<li><strong>Double-check contributor roles.</strong> “Edited by” is for editors, “Translated by” is for translators, “Directed by” is for performances.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid missing containers.</strong> Anthologies, databases, and streaming platforms often matter more than students expect.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-list-of-common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Quick list of common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leaving out the anthology or database container.</li>
<li>Using only the author in parentheses with no act, scene, line, or page.</li>
<li>Treating a filmed performance like a printed script.</li>
<li>Using initials instead of full first names in Works Cited entries, when the full name is available.</li>
<li>Using “n.d.” or “Anonymous” instead of starting with the title when no author is listed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell me which type of play source you are using, printed book, anthology excerpt, database text, or recorded performance, I can format 2 to 3 citations that match your exact assignment and show the best in-text citation style for that version.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-play-in-mla-works-cited-if-i-read-it-in-a-book">How do I cite a play in MLA Works Cited if I read it in a book?</h3>
<p>When you read a play in a printed book, your Works Cited entry usually starts with the playwright, then the play title in italics, followed by the book details. A common format is: Author Last Name, First Name. Title of Play. Title of Book, edited by Editor Name, Publisher, Year, pp. xx-xx. If the play is the whole book, you can omit page range. For example, if you read Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman in a collected volume edited by someone else, you cite the container (the book) because that is how you accessed the play. In your in-text citation, include the author and page number, or author and act.scene.line if your edition uses line numbering. For official guidance and more examples, see the MLA Works Cited basics and the “containers” concept: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-lines-from-a-play-in-mla-in-text-citations-act-scene-line">How do I cite lines from a play in MLA in-text citations (act, scene, line)?</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations for plays often use divisions like act, scene, and line numbers, especially when the text has consistent line numbering. After quoting or paraphrasing, cite the relevant location in parentheses. Many instructors prefer a format like (Shakespeare 1.3.55-57), meaning act 1, scene 3, lines 55 to 57, with periods separating the parts. If you name the playwright in your sentence, you can shorten the parenthetical to just the numbers: (1.3.55-57). If your edition uses page numbers instead of line numbers, use page numbers: (Miller 23). For prose plays without line numbering, cite page numbers. If you cite dialogue, you still use the same locator system. MLA’s guidance on in-text citations is here: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-format-a-block-quote-from-a-play-in-mla-especially-with-dialogue">How do I format a block quote from a play in MLA, especially with dialogue?</h3>
<p>Use a block quote when the quotation runs more than four lines of your prose. For plays, keep the original line breaks and format character names in all caps followed by a period, then the dialogue. Indent the entire quotation one inch from the left margin. If a character’s speech runs to a new line, indent subsequent lines an additional quarter inch. Do not add quotation marks around a block quote. After the block, place the parenthetical citation after the final punctuation, using page numbers or act.scene.line, depending on your text. Practical example: if you quote a long exchange between two characters, preserve each speaker label and lineation so your reader can track the conversation. For detailed formatting examples of block quotations, see MLA: https://style.mla.org/block-quotes/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-play-i-watched-live-a-theater-performance-in-mla">How do I cite a play I watched live (a theater performance) in MLA?</h3>
<p>To cite a live performance, treat the performance as the work you experienced. Start with the play title in italics, then add key contributors and performance details. A typical entry looks like: Title of Play. By Playwright Name, directed by Director Name, performance by Key Performers if relevant, Theater Company, Venue, City, Day Month Year. If you do not know the playwright or director, include what you can, and prioritize the elements most relevant to your discussion. Practical scenario: if you are analyzing staging choices, include the director and theater company. If you are focusing on an actor’s interpretation, name that performer. Your in-text citation is usually a shortened title, since there is no page number: (Title of Play). For MLA guidance on citing performances and live events, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-play-from-an-online-database-or-website-in-mla">How do I cite a play from an online database or website in MLA?</h3>
<p>When you access a play online, cite the play as the source, then cite the website or database as the container. Start with the playwright and play title, then include the site name in italics, the publisher or sponsor if available, the publication date, the URL, and your access date if your instructor requires it or if the content is likely to change. Example structure: Playwright Last Name, First Name. Title of Play. Website or Database Name, Publisher, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year. Practical scenario: if you read a play on Project Gutenberg, the site functions as the container, but you should still record the specific page or section if available for your in-text citations. For MLA rules and examples for online works, see: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-play-from-an-anthology-or-a-textbook-and-what-if-there-are-multiple-editors">How do I cite a play from an anthology or a textbook, and what if there are multiple editors?</h3>
<p>If the play appears inside an anthology or textbook, your Works Cited entry should credit the playwright first, then the play title, then the anthology as the container. Include the editors after the anthology title, using “edited by” and listing names in the order shown on the title page. If there are multiple editors, list them all if practical, or follow your instructor’s preference, MLA commonly allows listing the first editor followed by “et al.” when there are many. Then include edition (if any), publisher, year, and page range for the play. Practical scenario: if you use a literature anthology for a class, the anthology page numbers are what you cite in-text, unless the anthology also provides act.scene.line numbering. For MLA guidance on citing parts of a book and editor formatting, see: https://style.mla.org/book-parts/ and https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
