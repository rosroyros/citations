<section class="content-section" id="what-a-cliffsnotes-source-is-in-mla">
<h2 >What a CliffsNotes source is in MLA</h2>
<p>CliffsNotes is a study guide resource. In MLA 9, you cite it the same way you cite most web pages or entries on a website. Your goal is to help readers find the exact page you used and to credit the people and organization responsible for the content.</p>
<p>Most CliffsNotes pages function like a web article. That means your citation usually includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author (if listed)</li>
<li>Title of the specific page (the page you read)</li>
<li>Title of the website (CliffsNotes)</li>
<li>Publisher or sponsoring organization (often the same as the site, you may omit it if it is identical to the website name)</li>
<li>Publication date (if listed)</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Accessed date (optional in MLA, but often helpful for web sources, especially if pages change)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because CliffsNotes pages are frequently updated and sometimes do not show clear dates or personal authors, MLA rules about missing information matter a lot.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-format-for-a-cliffsnotes-web-page">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 format for a CliffsNotes web page</h2>
<h3 id="standard-template">Standard template</h3>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Web Page." <em>Website Name</em>, Publisher (if different), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>For CliffsNotes, the website name is usually:</p>
<p><em>CliffsNotes</em></p>
<p>If there is no publisher separate from the website name, MLA allows you to omit the publisher element.</p>
<h3 id="quotation-marks-vs-italics">Quotation marks vs italics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put the <strong>title of the specific page</strong> in <strong>quotation marks</strong>, because it is a part of a larger website.</li>
<li>Put the <strong>website name</strong> in <strong>italics</strong>, because it is the container that holds the page.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules you must follow (and why they matter)</h2>
<p>Your rules emphasize author clarity and consistency. They also align with MLA’s purpose, which is to make sources easy to locate and to credit creators accurately.</p>
<h3 id="use-full-first-names-not-initials">Use full first names, not initials</h3>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Full first names reduce confusion, especially when multiple writers share a last name or when initials could match many people. It also respects author identity by not shortening it unnecessarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Smith, Jordan Michael.</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Smith, J. M.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="first-author-must-be-inverted">First author must be inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA Works Cited lists are alphabetized. Inverting the first author makes sorting consistent and predictable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Last, First Middle</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>First Middle Last</strong> (for the first author position)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors, use “and”, second author not inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA uses “and” to clearly show joint authorship. Keeping only the first author inverted preserves alphabetizing while keeping the second author readable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Garcia, Elena, and Marcus Lee.</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Garcia, Elena, &amp; Lee, Marcus.</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Garcia, Elena, and Lee, Marcus.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">Three or more authors, use “et al.” after the first author only</h3>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It keeps citations clean and readable while still crediting the primary author and signaling additional contributors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>Nguyen, Hannah, et al.</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Nguyen, Hannah, Lee, Marcus, and Patel, Rina.</strong></li>
<li>Incorrect: <strong>Nguyen, H., et al.</strong> (initials not allowed under your rules)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Many CliffsNotes pages do not list an individual author. MLA does not want you to invent one. Starting with the title ensures the entry can still be alphabetized and found.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use <strong>Anonymous</strong></li>
<li>Do not use <strong>n.d.</strong></li>
<li>Alphabetization ignores leading articles like <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, <strong>The</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 >Example 1, CliffsNotes page with one author (most complete case)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry">Works Cited entry</h3>
<p><strong>Reed, Allison Marie. "Hamlet Summary." <em>CliffsNotes</em>, 12 Mar. 2023, https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/hamlet/summary. Accessed 20 Dec. 2025.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-correctly">Why this is formatted correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reed, Allison Marie.</strong> The author is first and inverted, with a full first name.</li>
<li><strong>"Hamlet Summary."</strong> The specific page title is in quotation marks.</li>
<li>** <em>CliffsNotes</em>,** The website name is italicized as the container.</li>
<li><strong>12 Mar. 2023,</strong> MLA uses day month year when available. Month is abbreviated in MLA style.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong> is included without angle brackets.</li>
<li><strong>Accessed date</strong> is included as a practical choice for web content that can change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If CliffsNotes lists an author at the top of the page, use that personal author. If it lists an editor or a team name, treat that as the author only if it is clearly presented as the creator of the page.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-cliffsnotes-page-with-no-author-common-situation">
<h2 >Example 2, CliffsNotes page with no author (common situation)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry">Works Cited entry</h3>
<p><strong>"Character List: Jay Gatsby." <em>CliffsNotes</em>, https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/g/the-great-gatsby/character-list. Accessed 20 Dec. 2025.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-correctly">Why this is formatted correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is <strong>no author</strong>, so the entry starts with the <strong>title</strong> in quotation marks.</li>
<li>The website name, <em>CliffsNotes</em>, is italicized.</li>
<li>No date is shown, so the citation simply moves on to the URL. MLA allows you to omit missing elements rather than adding placeholders like “n.d.”</li>
<li>The accessed date is helpful because undated pages are more likely to change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alphabetization-note">Alphabetization note</h3>
<p>This entry would be alphabetized under <strong>C</strong> for <strong>Character</strong>, not under <strong>T</strong> for <strong>The</strong>, because the title does not begin with an article here. If your title did begin with “The,” you would still write “The” in the citation, but you would ignore it when alphabetizing.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-3-cliffsnotes-page-with-two-authors">
<h2 >Example 3, CliffsNotes page with two authors</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-entry">Works Cited entry</h3>

<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-correctly">Why this is formatted correctly</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted: <strong>Patel, Rina Saanvi</strong></li>
<li>Second author is normal order: <strong>Jordan Michael Smith</strong></li>
<li>“and” joins the authors, not an ampersand.</li>
<li>The page title is in quotation marks. The play title inside it is italicized because it is a standalone work.</li>
<li>Website name is italicized.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-for-cliffsnotes-specifically">
<h2 >Why these rules matter for CliffsNotes specifically</h2>
<h3 id="cliffsnotes-pages-can-look-similar">CliffsNotes pages can look similar</h3>
<p>Many CliffsNotes URLs follow similar patterns, and multiple pages may have similar titles like “Summary” or “Themes.” Accurate titles and URLs prevent readers from landing on the wrong page.</p>
<h3 id="authorship-is-sometimes-unclear">Authorship is sometimes unclear</h3>
<p>CliffsNotes may list no author, a staff name, or a contributor. If you apply consistent author rules, your Works Cited stays trustworthy. Readers can see when a page is authorless and judge credibility appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="web-content-changes">Web content changes</h3>
<p>Study guide sites update pages. Including an accessed date is a practical way to show when you viewed the information, especially if a teacher wants to verify it later.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<h3 id="using-initials-for-authors">Using initials for authors</h3>
<p>Do not shorten first names to initials under your rules. Always use the full first name if it is available.</p>
<h3 id="inverting-the-second-author-in-a-two-author-citation">Inverting the second author in a two author citation</h3>
<p>Only the first author is inverted. The second stays in normal order.</p>
<h3 id="listing-all-authors-when-there-are-three-or-more">Listing all authors when there are three or more</h3>
<p>Use the first author only, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not add additional names before it.</p>
<h3 id="treating-cliffsnotes-as-the-author-automatically">Treating “CliffsNotes” as the author automatically</h3>
<p>If a personal author is listed, use that. If no personal author is listed, start with the title. You can use a corporate author only when the site clearly presents the organization as the author of that specific page, but many CliffsNotes pages work better as no author entries.</p>
<h3 id="forgetting-quotation-marks-around-the-page-title">Forgetting quotation marks around the page title</h3>
<p>The specific page is a smaller part of the larger website, so it should be in quotation marks.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-up-italics">Mixing up italics</h3>
<p>Italicize the website name <em>CliffsNotes</em>. Do not italicize the web page title.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Cliffsnotes citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-cliffsnotes-citations-have-special-cases-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Why CliffsNotes citations have special cases in MLA 9</h2>
<p>CliffsNotes sources often look simple, but they create edge cases because they can appear in several formats at once. A single “CliffsNotes” item might be a web page, a chapter within a larger online guide, a PDF, a republished print booklet, or an entry in a database. MLA 9 asks you to cite what you actually used, in the form you used it, and to be specific about containers. That is where most mistakes happen.</p>
<p>Your author rules also matter more with CliffsNotes than with many other sources. CliffsNotes pages sometimes show a corporate brand prominently, while the individual author name is smaller or placed at the bottom. MLA still prefers a person as the author when one is credited. When there is no credited person, you start with the title instead of inventing an author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-principle-treat-cliffsnotes-as-a-container-not-always-as-the-author">
<h2 >Core principle: treat “CliffsNotes” as a container, not always as the author</h2>
<p>In MLA, the “container” is the larger whole that holds the work you are citing. With CliffsNotes, the container might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CliffsNotes website (CliffsNotes)</li>
<li>A larger study guide on the site (for example, <em>The Great Gatsby</em>)</li>
<li>A database that hosts CliffsNotes content (for example, Gale, ProQuest, EBSCO)</li>
<li>A print series (for example, <em>CliffsNotes Literature Guides</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A common pitfall is to put “CliffsNotes” in the author slot just because it is the most visible label. Only use a corporate author if the page truly lists the organization as the author and no individual writer or editor is credited.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-no-listed-author-on-a-cliffsnotes-web-page">
<h2 >Special case 1: No listed author on a CliffsNotes web page</h2>
<p>Many CliffsNotes pages do not clearly credit an author. Under your rules, do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” Start with the title.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of the page, look for “Written by,” “By,” or an editor credit. If there is none, treat it as no author.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not place “CliffsNotes Editors” in the author slot unless the page explicitly uses that as the credited author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-corporate-author-versus-individual-author">
<h2 >Special case 2: Corporate author versus individual author</h2>
<p>Sometimes a CliffsNotes page credits an individual author, but the branding can make it easy to miss. If a person is credited, list that person as the author using full first names, not initials. The first author is inverted.</p>
<p>If the page is credited to the organization itself, then the organization can be the author. This is less common for CliffsNotes study pages, but it can occur in policy pages or general informational pages.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>MLA citations are designed to help readers locate the exact source and evaluate credibility. Crediting the actual writer is more precise than crediting the brand.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-two-authors-three-or-more-authors-and-what-to-do-when-cliffsnotes-lists-many-contributors">
<h2 >Special case 3: Two authors, three or more authors, and what to do when CliffsNotes lists many contributors</h2>
<p>Occasionally, a guide or section lists multiple contributors. Follow your author rules exactly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two authors: First author inverted, second author normal order, use “and.”</li>
<li>Three or more authors: First author inverted, then “et al.” Only the first author is named.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not list all authors and then add “et al.” Your rule requires only the first author plus “et al.” for three or more.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-the-page-title-versus-the-guide-title-and-avoiding-double-titles">
<h2 >Special case 4: The page title versus the guide title, and avoiding double titles</h2>
<p>CliffsNotes often structures content like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific page or section, such as “Character Analysis: Jay Gatsby”</li>
<li>Inside a larger guide, such as <em>The Great Gatsby</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In MLA terms, the specific page is usually the “work,” and the larger guide is the “container.” This affects formatting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific page title is usually in quotation marks.</li>
<li>The larger guide or website name is usually italicized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Students sometimes italicize the page title and also italicize the guide title, which blurs what is the part and what is the whole.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-missing-publication-date-and-what-to-do-instead">
<h2 >Special case 5: Missing publication date and what to do instead</h2>
<p>CliffsNotes pages sometimes do not show a clear publication date. Under your rules, do not write “n.d.” MLA 9 allows you to omit the date if it is not available.</p>
<p>If the page has a “last updated” date, use it. If it does not, leave the date out and include an access date if your instructor prefers it or if the content is likely to change.</p>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you include an access date, put it at the end: “Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.” Be consistent across your Works Cited.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-6-citing-cliffsnotes-content-from-a-database">
<h2 >Special case 6: Citing CliffsNotes content from a database</h2>
<p>Your “CliffsNotes” content might be accessed through a library database. In that case, the database becomes an additional container. You usually cite:</p>
<ol>
<li>The specific entry or section you used</li>
<li>The CliffsNotes product or book title as a container (if shown)</li>
<li>The database name as a second container</li>
<li>The URL or DOI provided by the database</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>
<p>If a reader tries to find your source, a CliffsNotes website URL will not help if you accessed it through a database paywall. The database link and container information make retrieval possible.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-7-print-cliffsnotes-versus-online-cliffsnotes">
<h2 >Special case 7: Print CliffsNotes versus online CliffsNotes</h2>
<p>Print CliffsNotes are cited like books or booklets. Online CliffsNotes are cited like web pages. Do not mix elements. For example, do not add a publisher and year from a print edition if you actually used the website page.</p>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Copying a citation template for a print CliffsNotes booklet and pasting a website URL at the end. That creates a hybrid citation that does not match any real source.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-8-citing-a-section-within-a-cliffsnotes-guide-as-a-chapter-or-web-page">
<h2 >Special case 8: Citing a section within a CliffsNotes guide as a “chapter” or “web page”</h2>
<p>CliffsNotes sections behave like chapters. In MLA, that usually means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the section title in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Put the guide title or the website name in italics as the container.</li>
<li>Add the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the section is clearly labeled as a chapter-like unit within a larger titled guide, treat it as a part of a whole, not as a standalone webpage with no container.</p>

“Character Analysis: Jay Gatsby.” <em>CliffsNotes</em>, www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/t/the-great-gatsby/character-analysis/jay-gatsby. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- No author is listed, so the citation starts with the page title in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>CliffsNotes</em> is the website container, italicized.<br />
- No date is included because it is not provided, and your rules prohibit “n.d.”<br />
- The access date helps because web content can change.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not start with “CliffsNotes” as the author when no author is given. Under your rules, start with the title.<br />
- Do not italicize the page title. It is a part of the site, so it stays in quotation marks.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-credited-on-a-cliffsnotes-guide-section">
<h2 >Example 2: Two authors credited on a CliffsNotes guide section</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Smith, Jordan Michael, and Taylor Renee Johnson. “Themes.” <em>CliffsNotes</em>, www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/hamlet/themes. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- Two authors are listed, so you include both.<br />
- The first author is inverted, “Smith, Jordan Michael.”<br />
- The second author is in normal order, “Taylor Renee Johnson,” and you use “and.”<br />
- The work cited is the specific section, “Themes,” in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>CliffsNotes</em> is the container.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not write “Smith, Jordan M.” Your rules require full first names, not initials.<br />
- Do not invert the second author’s name. Only the first author is inverted.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-3-three-or-more-authors-credited-use-et-al-and-cite-a-database-container-if-applicable">
<h2 >Example 3: Three or more authors credited, use “et al.” and cite a database container if applicable</h2>
<p>Imagine you accessed a CliffsNotes entry through a library database and the entry lists four authors.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong><br />
Garcia, Elena Marisol, et al. “Summary and Analysis.” <em>CliffsNotes</em>. <em>Gale Literature Resource Center</em>, link.gale.com/apps/doc/XXXXXXXX/LitRC. Accessed 1 Jan. 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- There are three or more authors, so you list only the first author, inverted, with the full first name, then add “et al.”<br />
- “Summary and Analysis” is the specific section title in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>CliffsNotes</em> is the first container, because it is the product hosting the content.<br />
- <em>Gale Literature Resource Center</em> is a second container, because that is where you retrieved it.<br />
- The database link is used because it is the most direct path for readers who have access.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not list multiple authors and then add “et al.” Your rule is first author only plus “et al.”<br />
- Do not use the public CliffsNotes URL if you did not access the public site. Cite the database path you actually used.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-plain-terms">
<h2 >Why these rules matter, in plain terms</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Readers can find the exact section you used, not just a general CliffsNotes homepage.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Naming the real author when available shows you are citing responsibly.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Using the same logic for titles, containers, and authors keeps your Works Cited clean and easy to scan.</li>
<li><strong>Fair credit:</strong> Full first names reduce confusion between authors with similar initials and better reflect the author’s identity, which aligns with your stated requirements.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-practical-checklist-for-cliffsnotes-edge-cases">
<h2 >Quick practical checklist for CliffsNotes edge cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look for a person credited as author or editor. If none, start with the title.</li>
<li>Decide what you are citing, a specific section page or an entire guide.</li>
<li>Use quotation marks for a section or page, italics for the website or guide container.</li>
<li>If you used a database, include the database as an additional container and use its stable link.</li>
<li>If no date is shown, omit it, and consider adding an access date.</li>
<li>Apply author formatting rules strictly, full first names, first author inverted, “and” for two authors, “et al.” for three or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you share a specific CliffsNotes page link or a screenshot of the top and bottom of the page, I can show the exact Works Cited entry that matches your case and your author rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-cliffsnotes-page-in-mla-9">How do I cite a CliffsNotes page in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite a CliffsNotes page in MLA 9, treat it like a page on a website. In your Works Cited entry, start with the author of the page if listed, then put the page title in quotation marks. Next list the website name, CliffsNotes, the publisher if shown, usually Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the publication or last updated date if available, the URL, and your access date if you think the content may change. In the in text citation, use the author’s last name, or a shortened version of the page title if there is no author. Practical scenario, if you quote a theme explanation from a CliffsNotes study guide page with no author, cite it in text as ("Themes") and match that title to the Works Cited entry. For MLA basics, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-cite-cliffsnotes-as-a-book-or-as-a-website">Do I cite CliffsNotes as a book or as a website?</h3>
<p>Most CliffsNotes content you use for school papers is best cited as a website page, because you usually access it online and it functions as a web publication with a URL. You should cite it as a book only if you are using a print CliffsNotes book or an ebook that clearly presents itself as a book with an edition, publisher, and stable publication details. Practical scenario, if your teacher assigned the CliffsNotes website article on a novel’s characters, cite the specific web page. If you checked out a physical CliffsNotes guide from a library, cite it like a book and include the edition and publisher information from the title page. If you are unsure, choose the format that matches how your reader could retrieve the same source. More guidance on choosing containers is at https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-cliffsnotes-page-has-no-author-or-no-date">What if the CliffsNotes page has no author or no date?</h3>
<p>If there is no listed author on the CliffsNotes page, start the Works Cited entry with the page title in quotation marks. Then list CliffsNotes as the website name, followed by the publisher if provided, the date if available, the URL, and an access date. If there is no date, omit it and include an access date, since study guide pages can be updated. In text, use a shortened title in quotation marks, for example ("Character Analysis") rather than a missing author. Practical scenario, you paraphrase a summary section that does not show an author or update date. Your Works Cited entry begins with the summary page title, and your in text citation uses the shortened title. MLA guidance on missing elements and access dates is discussed at https://style.mla.org/citing-website-material/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-cliffsnotes-if-there-are-no-page-numbers">How do I do in text citations for CliffsNotes if there are no page numbers?</h3>
<p>MLA in text citations normally use author and page number, but web pages like CliffsNotes usually have no stable page numbers. Use the author’s last name if available, or a shortened page title if not. Do not invent paragraph numbers unless your instructor requires them. Instead, integrate a signal phrase in your sentence, then cite the author or title in parentheses. Practical scenario, you quote a definition of a symbol from a CliffsNotes analysis page. You might write, According to CliffsNotes, the symbol represents social pressure ("Symbols"). If the page lists an author, use that name instead. If you cite multiple CliffsNotes pages with similar titles, make the short titles distinct. For MLA in text citation rules, see https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-cliffsnotes-if-i-used-it-to-get-background-ideas-but-did-not-quote-it">How do I cite CliffsNotes if I used it to get background ideas but did not quote it?</h3>
<p>If CliffsNotes influenced your thinking, even without direct quotes, you should still cite it when you paraphrase its ideas or use it to support a claim. MLA treats paraphrase as a form of borrowing that needs credit. You can cite it in text with the author or shortened page title, and include the full entry in Works Cited. Practical scenario, you read CliffsNotes to understand a novel’s themes, then you restate one of those theme interpretations in your own words in your essay. Add a citation at the end of the sentence, for example ("Themes"). If CliffsNotes only helped you choose a topic but none of its specific ideas appear in your draft, you typically do not need to cite it. More on paraphrase and citation is at https://style.mla.org/paraphrase-cite/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-cliffsnotes-when-quoting-the-original-book-versus-quoting-cliffsnotes-commentary">How do I cite CliffsNotes when quoting the original book versus quoting CliffsNotes commentary?</h3>
<p>Cite the source you actually used. If you quote a line from the novel itself, cite the novel, not CliffsNotes, even if you found the quotation there. CliffsNotes is not the authoritative text of the book. If you quote or paraphrase CliffsNotes commentary, summaries, or analyses, then cite the CliffsNotes page. Practical scenario, you take a sentence of character analysis from CliffsNotes, cite CliffsNotes. If you take a passage from the novel that CliffsNotes displays, locate the passage in your edition of the novel and cite that edition’s page number, or the standard division such as act, scene, and line numbers for plays. If you cannot verify the quotation in the original, avoid using it. MLA guidance on citing sources you actually consulted is discussed at https://style.mla.org/citing-indirect-sources/.</p>
