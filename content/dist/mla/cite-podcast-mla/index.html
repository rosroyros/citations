<section class="content-section" id="podcasts-general-mla-9-citation-format">
<h2 >Podcasts (General), MLA 9 Citation Format</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a podcast citation usually looks like a mix of an audio source and a web source. The goal is to help your reader quickly identify what you listened to, who is responsible for it, where it was published, and how to find it. MLA is flexible, but it still follows a consistent order of elements.</p>
<p>A “podcast” can mean a whole show (a series) or one specific episode. Most student citations are for a single episode, because that is what you actually used as evidence. If you used the entire show as your source, you can cite the show as a whole instead.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-you-are-usually-citing-an-episode-vs-a-whole-podcast">
<h2 >What you are usually citing: an episode vs. a whole podcast</h2>
<h3 id="citing-a-single-episode-most-common">Citing a single episode (most common)</h3>
<p>Use this when you quote, summarize, or refer to content from one episode.</p>
<p>Typical structure:</p>
<p><strong>Author or Host. “Episode Title.” <em>Podcast Title</em>, Publisher or Network, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>You may also include a platform (like Spotify or Apple Podcasts) if it helps your reader find the episode, especially when the publisher is unclear or the URL is long.</p>
<h3 id="citing-the-podcast-as-a-whole-less-common">Citing the podcast as a whole (less common)</h3>
<p>Use this when your discussion is about the podcast overall, such as its themes across many episodes.</p>
<p>Typical structure:</p>
<p><strong>Author or Host. <em>Podcast Title</em>, Publisher or Network, Years active, URL.</strong></p>
<p>If you do not know the years active, you can often omit them, or use the start year and a dash is common in MLA, but your rules prohibit em dashes. You can write a range like “2019 to present” if needed.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-elements-for-podcasts-in-order">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 elements for podcasts (in order)</h2>
<p>MLA 9 is built around a standard set of “core elements.” For podcasts, you will use most of these:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Author</strong> (often the host, narrator, or creator)</li>
<li><strong>Title of source</strong> (episode title, in quotation marks)</li>
<li><strong>Title of container</strong> (podcast title, in italics)</li>
<li><strong>Other contributors</strong> (optional, like “Produced by…”, “Guest…”, if important)</li>
<li><strong>Version</strong> (rare for podcasts)</li>
<li><strong>Number</strong> (season and episode numbers, if helpful)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> (network or company that publishes the podcast)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> (URL or DOI)</li>
</ol>
<p>Not every podcast page shows all of these. MLA allows you to include what is available and relevant.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules you must follow (and why they matter)</h2>
<p>Your rules add important constraints that affect how you format names. These rules matter because MLA citations are used for two main jobs: giving credit and helping your reader locate the source. Names are also used to alphabetize your Works Cited list, so consistent formatting prevents confusion.</p>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Author names must use full first names, not initials.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Initials can hide identity or create ambiguity. “J. Smith” could be many people, but “Jordan Smith” is clearer. It also shows respect for the creator’s identity.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the podcast only lists initials, look for the full name on the podcast website, the host bio, or the network page. If you truly cannot find it, use what is provided, but your guide’s rule prefers full names whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-inverted">First author inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> The first author must be inverted, Last, First Middle.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element, often the author’s last name. Inversion makes sorting consistent and easy.</p>
<p>Example of inversion:<br />
- Garcia, Elena Marisol.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors, use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For two authors, use “and” between names. Only the first author is inverted.</p>
<p>Correct pattern:<br />
- Garcia, Elena Marisol, and Thomas Edward Reed.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA uses “and” for readability and consistency. Keeping the second author in normal order prevents awkward double inversion.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Three or more authors, use “et al.”</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For three or more authors, list only the first author (inverted, with full first name), then add “et al.”</p>
<p>Correct pattern:<br />
- Garcia, Elena Marisol, et al.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It keeps citations readable while still crediting the group. It also avoids long, cluttered entries.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> If there is no author, start with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA treats the title as the identifying element when authorship is unclear. This also supports correct alphabetization.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For alphabetizing, ignore A, An, and The at the start of the title.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-and-punctuation-what-to-italicize-and-what-to-quote">
<h2 >Titles and punctuation, what to italicize and what to quote</h2>
<h3 id="episode-title-in-quotation-marks">Episode title in quotation marks</h3>
<p>The episode is a smaller work within a larger container, so it goes in quotation marks.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
- “Why We Remember.”</p>
<h3 id="podcast-title-in-italics">Podcast title in italics</h3>
<p>The podcast series is the container, so it is italicized.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
- <em>Memory Lab</em></p>
<h3 id="publisher-and-date">Publisher and date</h3>
<p>Include the publisher or network if available, then the date of the episode.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
- Radiant Audio, 14 Mar. 2024,</p>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>End with the direct URL to the episode page when possible.</p>
<p>Tip: MLA 9 does not require “https://” in every case, but including the full link is often the simplest and most reliable approach.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author:</strong> “Reed, Thomas Edward.” The name is inverted and uses a full first name.</li>
<li><strong>Episode title:</strong> In quotation marks because it is one part of a larger series.</li>
<li><strong>Podcast title:</strong> Italicized as the container.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher:</strong> “Cedar House Media” identifies who publishes the series.</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> Given in day month year format, which is MLA’s standard.</li>
<li><strong>URL:</strong> Provides the location so a reader can find the episode.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If the podcast lists a host name and a separate producer, usually the host or the credited creator is the best “Author” choice. Only list a producer as an “Other contributor” if your assignment focuses on production, editing, or sound design.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First author inverted:</strong> “Nguyen, Alina Rose”</li>
<li><strong>Second author normal order:</strong> “Javier Mateo Santos,” not inverted.</li>
<li><strong>“and” between names:</strong> Required for two authors.</li>
<li>The rest follows the same episode, container, publisher, date, and URL pattern.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall-to-avoid">Common pitfall to avoid</h3>
<p>Do not write both names inverted. This is a frequent mistake, especially when students copy patterns from databases. The correct MLA pattern only inverts the first author.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-correct">Why this is correct</h3>
<ul>
<li>No host or creator is credited clearly, so the entry begins with the <strong>title of the episode</strong>.</li>
<li>The episode title is still in quotation marks.</li>
<li>The podcast title remains italicized as the container.</li>
<li>No “Anonymous” is used, and no placeholder date is added.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Before deciding there is no author, check the episode page carefully. Many podcast pages list a host name near the audio player, in the show notes, or under “About.” If you find a clear host or creator, use that person as the author.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Podcasts (General) citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="podcast-citations-in-mla-9-special-cases-and-edge-cases">
<h2 >Podcast citations in MLA 9, special cases and edge cases</h2>
<p>Podcast citations look simple at first, but they have more moving parts than many other sources. Podcasts can be treated as a whole program (the series), a single episode, or even a segment within an episode. They also often involve multiple contributors, hosts, guest speakers, producers, and corporate teams, which creates confusion about who counts as the “author.” MLA 9 tries to solve this by focusing on the “core elements” and by encouraging you to cite the person or group most responsible for the content you used.</p>
<p>The special cases below focus on the situations that most often cause errors, especially around names, titles, and missing information.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="choosing-what-you-are-citing-episode-vs-entire-podcast">
<h2 >Choosing what you are citing, episode vs. entire podcast</h2>
<h3 id="when-to-cite-an-episode">When to cite an episode</h3>
<p>Cite an episode when you are using information from one specific installment. This is the most common case in academic writing. In MLA, the episode title usually appears in quotation marks, and the podcast (the series title) appears in italics.</p>
<p>Why it matters: your reader needs to find the exact audio you used. Citing the whole series when you used one episode makes the source harder to locate and can look careless.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-cite-the-entire-podcast">When to cite the entire podcast</h3>
<p>Cite the entire podcast series when your discussion covers the show as a whole, for example its overall themes, format, or recurring approach. In that case, the series title is italicized and becomes the main title element.</p>
<p>Why it matters: an episode citation implies a specific installment, while a series citation implies an ongoing program. MLA formatting signals that difference.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-and-contributor-edge-cases-who-goes-first">
<h2 >Author and contributor edge cases (who goes first)</h2>
<h3 id="host-vs-creator-vs-narrator">Host vs. creator vs. narrator</h3>
<p>Podcasts often list a host, but the host is not always the best “author” choice. Use the person or group that seems most responsible for the content you are citing.</p>
<p>Practical approach:<br />
- If one person is clearly presented as the main creator or host of the episode, you can list that person as the author.<br />
- If the episode is primarily an interview and the guest is the main source of information, you can still list the host as author, then describe the guest in the “contributors” part if needed.<br />
- If a company or newsroom is clearly the authoring body (common for news podcasts), you can use the organization as the author.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: listing every role you see, such as host, producer, editor, sound designer. MLA does not require a full credit roll. Prioritize what helps identify the source and what supports your claim.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-three-or-more-authors-your-required-name-rules">Two authors, three or more authors (your required name rules)</h3>
<p>When an episode has multiple credited authors or hosts, apply your rules consistently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One author</strong>: Invert the first author’s name, use full first name.</li>
<li>Last, First Middle.</li>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: First author inverted. Second author in normal order, full name. Use <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: First author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the others.</li>
<li>Last, First Middle, et al.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why it matters: consistent name formatting makes your Works Cited easy to scan and alphabetize. It also prevents ambiguity, especially when initials could match multiple people.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-listed">No author listed</h3>
<p>If no individual or organization is given as author, start with the title of the episode or the podcast series, depending on what you are citing. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<p>Why it matters: MLA treats the title as the identifying handle when authorship is unclear. This keeps citations honest and traceable.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="title-edge-cases-episode-title-vs-series-title-and-season-labels">
<h2 >Title edge cases, episode title vs. series title, and “season” labels</h2>
<h3 id="episodes-without-clear-titles">Episodes without clear titles</h3>
<p>Some platforms show episode titles like “Episode 42” or “Season 3, Episode 7.” Use the title exactly as displayed. If the episode has no meaningful title beyond numbering, that is still the title.</p>
<p>Tip: If the episode title is only a number, consider adding a short description in your prose, not inside the Works Cited entry, so your reader understands what you used.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts-with-subtitles-or-punctuation">Podcasts with subtitles or punctuation</h3>
<p>Use the title as it appears. If the series title includes a colon and subtitle, keep it. Italicize the full series title.</p>
<p>Common pitfall: italicizing the episode title and putting the series in quotation marks. In MLA, it is usually the opposite for an episode citation, episode in quotation marks, series in italics.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="publisher-and-platform-complications">
<h2 >Publisher and platform complications</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-the-publisher-for-a-podcast">Who is the “publisher” for a podcast</h3>
<p>In MLA, the publisher is often the network, studio, or organization behind the podcast, such as NPR, Pushkin Industries, or a university center. The platform where you listened (Spotify, Apple Podcasts) can sometimes function like a container or access point, but it is not always the publisher.</p>
<p>Practical tip: If the podcast page lists a network or production company, use that as the publisher. If it does not, you can use the platform as the second container or omit the publisher if it would mislead.</p>
<h3 id="same-podcast-on-multiple-platforms">Same podcast on multiple platforms</h3>
<p>Cite the version you actually used. If you listened on Spotify, cite Spotify. If you listened on the show’s website, cite the website.</p>
<p>Why it matters: URLs, episode pages, and availability vary by platform. Your reader should be able to follow your citation to the same place you accessed.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="dates-missing-dates-and-updated-entries">
<h2 >Dates, missing dates, and “updated” entries</h2>
<h3 id="full-date-vs-year-only">Full date vs. year only</h3>

<h3 id="no-date-provided">No date provided</h3>
<p>If no date is available, omit the date rather than inventing one. Do not use “n.d.”</p>
<p>Tip: Check the episode page on the publisher’s site, not just the app view. Apps sometimes hide dates.</p>

<p>Use a stable URL when possible, such as the episode’s webpage. If the only option is a platform link, use that. MLA 9 allows URLs without “https://,” but consistency matters. Use whatever style your guide prefers, and keep it consistent.</p>
<h3 id="time-stamps-an-important-edge-case-for-podcasts">Time stamps (an important edge case for podcasts)</h3>
<p>Podcasts are audio, so page numbers do not exist. If you quote or refer to a specific moment, include a time stamp in your in-text citation or in your prose.</p>
<p>Common practice:<br />
- In-text: (LastName 12:35–13:10)<br />
- Or in prose: At 12:35, the host explains that…</p>
<p>Why it matters: time stamps are the podcast equivalent of page numbers. They let the reader verify your quotation quickly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is formatted correctly</strong><br />
- <strong>Author</strong>: Malcolm Gladwell is listed with full first name, and the first author is inverted, Gladwell, Malcolm.<br />
- <strong>Episode title</strong>: “The King of Tears” is in quotation marks because it is a part of a larger work.<br />
- <strong>Podcast series title</strong>: <em>Revisionist History</em> is italicized because it is the container, the larger work.<br />
- <strong>Publisher</strong>: Pushkin Industries is the producing organization.<br />
- <strong>Date</strong>: Full date is included.<br />
- <strong>Location</strong>: A direct URL is provided so the reader can find the episode.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you quote a line from the episode, add a time stamp in your in-text citation, for example: (Gladwell 18:42–19:05).</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is formatted correctly</strong><br />
- <strong>Two authors</strong>: The first author is inverted, Abdurraqib, Hanif. The second author is in normal order, Josie Duffy Rice. The word <strong>and</strong> joins them.<br />
- <strong>Full first names</strong>: Both names use full first names, not initials.<br />
- <strong>Episode then series</strong>: Episode title in quotation marks, series title in italics.<br />
- <strong>Publisher and platform</strong>: A network is listed as publisher. Spotify is used as the access location because that is where it was heard.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall</strong><br />
Do not invert the second author. Writing “Rice, Josie Duffy” would break MLA’s two-author name pattern and make alphabetizing inconsistent.</p>

<p><strong>Why this is formatted correctly</strong><br />

- <strong>Date and URL</strong>: Included to help the reader locate the exact episode.</p>
<p><strong>How to handle quoting</strong><br />
If you quote a statement at 07:18, your in-text citation can look like this: (“A Brief History of Vaccine Patents” 07:18). If the title is long, you can shorten it in the in-text citation, as long as it clearly matches the Works Cited entry.</p>

<h2 >Common pitfalls and quick fixes</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Listing too many contributors</strong>: Focus on the main author or host. Add roles only when they clarify responsibility.</li>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>MLA podcast citations are about traceability. Your reader should be able to identify the exact audio, the responsible creator, and the path to access it. Following consistent name rules, especially full first names and the correct inversion pattern, also supports accurate alphabetization and respectful attribution. Podcasts change feeds, move platforms, and get reposted, so clear titles, dates, and stable links make your citations durable and useful.</p>
<p>If you want, I can also provide a fill-in template for episode citations and a separate template for citing an entire podcast series, both adapted to your author-name rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-podcast-episode-in-mla-9-and-what-details-do-i-need">How do I cite a podcast episode in MLA 9, and what details do I need?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, a podcast episode is usually cited like an audio work in a series. Start with the episode title in quotation marks. Then give the podcast title in italics, followed by the host or relevant contributor (for example, “hosted by” or “produced by”), the publisher or network, the date of the episode, and the URL. Include the platform only if it is important for retrieval or context. A practical scenario is citing an interview episode you streamed on Spotify, you still cite the episode and series, then use the episode’s stable web URL if available. If you cannot find a stable URL, use the platform’s share link. MLA does not require an access date, but you may add “Accessed” if the episode changes or is likely to be removed. For more guidance, see MLA on containers and URLs: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-cite-the-podcast-host-the-guest-or-the-producer-as-the-author-in-mla">Do I cite the podcast host, the guest, or the producer as the author in MLA?</h3>
<p>Choose the contributor who best matches what you are using. If you are discussing the episode as a whole, start with the episode title and list the host after the podcast title using a role label such as “hosted by.” If you are quoting a specific person, like a guest expert, you can begin the entry with that person’s name, then give the episode title, the podcast title, and the role information. For example, if you quote the guest’s claim about climate data, starting with the guest helps readers connect the quotation to the speaker. If multiple people matter, name the primary one first and include others after the title using role phrases. Keep roles clear, for example, “hosted by,” “guest,” “produced by.” For role formatting and contributor choices, consult MLA’s author guidance: https://style.mla.org/author/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-whole-podcast-series-instead-of-a-single-episode-in-mla-9">How do I cite a whole podcast series instead of a single episode in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite an entire podcast series, use the podcast title in italics as the main title element, since the series is the work you are referencing. Then include the host or creator, if relevant, plus the publisher or network, the span of years if known (for example, 2018 to 2024), and the URL for the series home page. This is useful when you reference the podcast generally, such as describing the show’s themes, format, or overall approach, rather than one specific episode. If the series is ongoing, you can list the start year followed by a hyphen with no end year. If you cannot determine the year span, include the date of the most recent update if shown. For series level citations and containers, review MLA’s Works Cited guidance: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-podcast-episode-has-no-clear-date-or-the-date-differs-across-apple-podcasts-spotify-and-the-website">What if the podcast episode has no clear date, or the date differs across Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and the website?</h3>
<p>Use the most reliable date associated with the episode, preferably from the publisher’s own site or the episode page provided by the network. If Apple Podcasts lists a different date than the official site, prioritize the official source, since platforms sometimes show upload dates, regional release dates, or re release dates. If no date is available, omit it, do not invent a date. You can add an access date, for example, “Accessed 1 Jan. 2026,” especially if the listing is unstable or the episode page frequently changes. In a practical scenario, if you cite a back catalog episode that was re posted, you may include the date shown on the page you used, and optionally note “originally released” in your prose if that context matters. For date rules, see MLA’s date guidance: https://style.mla.org/dates/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-podcasts-in-mla-especially-when-quoting-something-said-at-a-specific-time">How do I do in-text citations for podcasts in MLA, especially when quoting something said at a specific time?</h3>
<p>MLA in text citations usually use the first element of the Works Cited entry, often the episode title in quotation marks, or a person’s last name if your entry begins with a speaker. Podcasts do not have page numbers, so you normally cite only that first element. If you need precision, you can add a time stamp in your prose or in the parenthetical, for example, (“Episode Title” 12:34 to 13:10). A practical scenario is quoting a host’s statement at 18 minutes, you could write, The host argues that the policy “fails on cost” (“Episode Title” 18:02). If your Works Cited entry starts with the guest’s name, you can cite (GuestLastName 18:02). For more on MLA in text citations, see: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-cite-the-url-the-app-or-the-platform-and-what-if-the-episode-is-behind-a-paywall">Should I cite the URL, the app, or the platform, and what if the episode is behind a paywall?</h3>
<p>Include a direct URL whenever possible, ideally the episode’s public webpage or a stable share link. MLA generally prefers URLs over naming an app, because URLs help readers locate the source. Mention the platform only when it adds clarity, such as when an episode is exclusive to a service. If the episode is behind a paywall, cite the URL you used, and in your prose you can note that it requires a subscription. If there is no public URL, use the platform name as the container and provide whatever locator is available, such as an episode ID, plus an access date. A practical scenario is citing a Patreon only episode, you can cite the episode page URL and add “Accessed” since availability can change. For MLA guidance on URLs and access dates, see: https://style.mla.org/urls/.</p>
