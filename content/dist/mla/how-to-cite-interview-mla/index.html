<h2 >How to Cite Interviews in MLA 9 (Works Cited and In Text)</h2>
<p>In MLA 9th edition, interviews are cited a little differently depending on how you accessed them. The core goal is always the same, help readers identify who was interviewed, who conducted the interview (if relevant), where it appeared, and how you found it. MLA also wants citations to be consistent so that a Works Cited list can be alphabetized and scanned quickly.</p>
<p>Below are the most common interview situations and the correct MLA 9 formats, with examples and explanations.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-counts-as-an-interview-in-mla">
<h2 >What Counts as an Interview in MLA?</h2>
<p>MLA treats an interview as information given by a person in response to questions. You might have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal interview you conducted (in person, phone, Zoom, email)</li>
<li>An interview published in a magazine, newspaper, or website</li>
<li>An interview in a video or podcast</li>
<li>An interview quoted inside another source (a transcript, an article, a documentary)</li>
</ul>
<p>The citation changes based on whether the interview is “standalone” (the interview itself is the source) or “contained” inside a larger work (a webpage, a journal, a YouTube video, a podcast episode).</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-rule-start-with-the-interviewee">
<h2 >The Core Rule: Start With the Interviewee</h2>
<p>In MLA, the interviewee is usually treated as the main author because they are the person providing the content. That means the Works Cited entry typically begins with the interviewee’s name, and the first author name is inverted.</p>
<p>Your rules about names matter here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use full first names, not initials.</li>
<li>Invert the first author name: Last, First Middle.</li>
<li>If there are two authors (less common for interviews), use “and” and do not invert the second name.</li>
<li>If there are three or more authors, use “et al.” after the first author only.</li>
</ul>
<p>For interviews, you will most often have one interviewee, so the first rule is the one you will use most.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="works-cited-format-for-a-personal-interview-you-conducted-it">
<h2 >Works Cited Format for a Personal Interview (You Conducted It)</h2>
<h3 id="basic-format">Basic format</h3>
<p><strong>Interviewee Last Name, Interviewee First Name Middle.</strong> <em>Description of interview.</em> <strong>Day Month Year.</strong></p>
<p>MLA commonly uses “Personal interview” as the description. If the interview took place by email or another method, you can specify that, for example “Email interview.”</p>
<h3 id="example-1-personal-interview-in-person-or-live-conversation">Example 1: Personal interview (in person or live conversation)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Rivera, Carmen Luisa. Personal interview. 12 Oct. 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In text</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: (Rivera)<br />
- Or in a signal phrase: Rivera explained that …</p>
<h3 id="why-this-format-works">Why this format works</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rivera, Carmen Luisa</strong> is inverted so the entry alphabetizes under R.</li>
<li><strong>Personal interview</strong> tells readers it is not published and cannot be retrieved by them, which is important for transparency.</li>
<li><strong>The date</strong> helps readers understand when the information was given, since interview responses can change over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you interviewed someone multiple times, include more detail to separate them, such as “Telephone interview” or include the month and year clearly. MLA does not require a location for personal interviews, but clarity is helpful.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="works-cited-format-for-a-published-interview-on-a-website">
<h2 >Works Cited Format for a Published Interview on a Website</h2>
<p>When an interview appears on a website, it is usually a “work in a container.” The interview is the item, and the website is the container.</p>
<h3 id="basic-format">Basic format</h3>
<p><strong>Interviewee Last Name, Interviewee First Name Middle.</strong> “Title of Interview.” <em>Website Name</em>, publisher (if different from website name), <strong>Day Month Year</strong>, URL. Accessed <strong>Day Month Year</strong> (optional but often useful).</p>
<p>If there is no title, you can write: <strong>Interview.</strong> or <strong>Interview by First Last.</strong> as the description.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-interview-published-online-with-an-interviewer">Example 2: Interview published online (with an interviewer)</h3>
<p>Imagine an interview with author Min Jin Lee, conducted by Jane Park, published on a site called Literary Voices.</p>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Lee, Min Jin. “Writing History Through Fiction.” <em>Literary Voices</em>, interview by Jane Park, 8 May 2023, https://www.literaryvoices.org/interviews/lee-writing-history. Accessed 20 Aug. 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In text</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: (Lee)<br />
- Or: Lee argues that …</p>
<h3 id="why-these-details-matter">Why these details matter</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interviewee first</strong>: MLA prioritizes the person whose words you are using.</li>
<li><strong>Title in quotation marks</strong>: The interview is a short work within a larger site.</li>
<li><strong>Website name italicized</strong>: The container is a complete work.</li>
<li><strong>“Interview by Jane Park”</strong>: This clarifies who asked the questions. It also helps readers evaluate perspective, since interview questions can shape answers.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong>: Online interviews often have no stable page numbers, so the URL is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Accessed date</strong>: Not always required in MLA 9, but helpful when web content changes or is updated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not start the citation with the interviewer if you are mainly using the interviewee’s statements. Start with the interviewee unless your assignment specifically treats the interviewer as the author of the piece.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="works-cited-format-for-a-video-interview-youtube-or-another-platform">
<h2 >Works Cited Format for a Video Interview (YouTube or Another Platform)</h2>
<p>A video interview is also a container situation. You cite the person or group responsible for the content you are using, often the interviewee, sometimes the channel or organization if authorship is unclear.</p>
<h3 id="basic-format-when-interviewee-is-clear">Basic format (when interviewee is clear)</h3>
<p><strong>Interviewee Last Name, Interviewee First Name Middle.</strong> “Title of Video.” <em>Website Name</em>, uploaded by Channel or Organization, <strong>Day Month Year</strong>, URL.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-video-interview-on-youtube">Example 3: Video interview on YouTube</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Adichie, Chimamanda Ngozi. “Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on Storytelling and Power.” <em>YouTube</em>, uploaded by PEN America, 14 Mar. 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In text</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: (Adichie)<br />
- Or: Adichie notes that …</p>
<h3 id="why-this-format-works">Why this format works</h3>
<ul>
<li>The interviewee’s name comes first because you are citing her ideas and statements.</li>
<li>The platform is italicized as the container, here <em>YouTube</em>.</li>
<li>“Uploaded by” credits the account responsible for publishing the video. This is useful because the uploader can affect reliability and context.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If you are quoting a specific moment, include a time range in your in-text citation when possible. MLA allows time stamps, for example: (Adichie 12:14–12:58). If your instructor prefers no time stamps, follow their guidance.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="in-text-citations-for-interviews">
<h2 >In-Text Citations for Interviews</h2>
<h3 id="general-rule">General rule</h3>
<p>In-text citations match the first element of the Works Cited entry, usually the interviewee’s last name.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Rivera)</li>
<li>(Lee)</li>
<li>(Adichie)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you mention the interviewee in your sentence, you often do not need a parenthetical citation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lee describes revision as “a form of rethinking memory.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For personal interviews, there are no page numbers. For videos, use time stamps if helpful and allowed.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-the-name-rules-matter-and-how-they-apply-to-interviews">
<h2 >Why the Name Rules Matter (And How They Apply to Interviews)</h2>
<p>Your rules emphasize full first names and correct inversion. These rules matter because they:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improve clarity</strong>, many people share the same last name, and initials can be ambiguous.</li>
<li><strong>Support accurate alphabetizing</strong>, inverted first author names keep Works Cited lists consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Respect identity</strong>, full names reduce confusion and avoid flattening a person’s identity into initials.</li>
</ol>
<p>In interview citations, the interviewee is usually the first element, so you should write the full first name and invert it, for example “Rivera, Carmen Luisa,” not “Rivera, C. L.”</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="no-title-or-no-author-situations-common-with-interviews">
<h2 >No Title or No Author Situations (Common With Interviews)</h2>
<p>Sometimes an interview has no clear title. MLA lets you replace the title with a description like “Interview” or “Interview by Jane Park.” If there is truly no credited interviewee or no identifiable person being interviewed, then you may need to start with the title of the page or video. Follow your no author rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the title.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous.”</li>
<li>Do not use “n.d.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If a webpage has no date, MLA allows you to omit the date and include an access date.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">
<h2 >Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Putting the interviewer first when you are quoting the interviewee.</strong> Usually start with the interviewee.</li>
<li><strong>Using initials instead of full first names.</strong> Use full first names to match your guide’s rules.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the container.</strong> A website name, platform, or publication title is often required.</li>
<li><strong>Missing the date.</strong> Interviews are time sensitive, include the date when available.</li>
<li><strong>Treating a transcript like a personal interview.</strong> If the transcript is published, cite it as a published source with a container.</li>

<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Interview Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="overview-what-counts-as-an-interview-in-mla-9">
<h2 >Overview, what counts as an “interview” in MLA 9</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, “interview” can mean several different situations, and the details of the citation change depending on how the interview was conducted and where you found it. The most common categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal interview you conducted</strong> (in person, phone, video call, email, text message).</li>
<li><strong>Published interview</strong> (in a book, magazine, newspaper, or website).</li>
<li><strong>Broadcast or recorded interview</strong> (podcast episode, radio segment, TV episode, livestream, YouTube video).</li>
<li><strong>Interview content inside another work</strong> (an interview quoted or excerpted in a documentary, article, or book chapter).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are “special cases” because the interview is often not a standalone source. It might be embedded in a larger container (a website, a podcast series, a magazine issue), or it might not have stable publication details. MLA’s container system helps you cite what you used while still giving readers a path to find it.</p>
<p>Your author name rules also matter here because interviews often involve multiple people, and it can be unclear who should be treated as the author. MLA’s goal is to make the Works Cited entry easy to alphabetize and easy for a reader to locate.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-1-interviews-you-conducted-including-phone-zoom-email-texts">
<h2 >Special case 1, interviews you conducted (including phone, Zoom, email, texts)</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-cite-a-live-personal-interview-you-conducted">How to cite a live, personal interview you conducted</h3>
<p>If you interviewed someone yourself and the interview is not published, MLA treats it as an <strong>unpublished interview</strong>. You usually list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interviewee</strong> as the author, because they are the source of the information.</li>
<li>The label <strong>Interview</strong> (or sometimes “Personal interview”) as the title element.</li>
<li>The <strong>date</strong> of the interview.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can add a <strong>description of the format</strong> in the entry if it clarifies access, such as “Zoom interview” or “Email interview.” Keep it simple.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this rule matters:</strong> Readers cannot retrieve your private interview the way they can retrieve a book or webpage. The citation’s job is to document what happened, who spoke, and when, so your reader can evaluate credibility and context.</p>
<h3 id="edge-cases">Edge cases</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email or text interviews:</strong> These are still interviews. You can label them “Email interview” or “Text message interview” if it helps clarify the format.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing exchange:</strong> If an email interview spans multiple days, use the date of the message you are citing most directly, or use the date range if your instructor accepts it. If you use a range, keep it readable and consistent.</li>
<li><strong>No exact date:</strong> Try to recover the date from your records. If you truly cannot, you can omit the date, but that is a last resort because it weakens traceability.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-2-published-interviews-where-the-interviewer-is-credited">
<h2 >Special case 2, published interviews where the interviewer is credited</h2>
<p>A common confusion is whether the interviewer or the interviewee should be the “author.” In MLA practice, you usually start with the person whose work you are using as the main entry point. For interviews, that is often the <strong>interviewee</strong> because the content is their statements, but many published interviews are cataloged by the interviewer, especially if the interviewer wrote the piece and titled it.</p>
<p>A practical approach that works well in MLA 9 is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the interview is presented as a piece “by” the interviewer (the interviewer wrote the article and the interviewee is featured), you can list the <strong>interviewer as author</strong> and name the interviewee in the title or description.</li>
<li>If the interview is clearly framed as “Interview with [Interviewee],” you can list the <strong>interviewee as author</strong> and treat it as an interview.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this rule matters:</strong> MLA wants the Works Cited entry to match how a reader will search for the source. If the webpage or magazine lists the interviewer as the author, starting with the interviewer can be more findable.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-3-interviews-in-a-container-website-magazine-database-youtube-podcast">
<h2 >Special case 3, interviews in a container (website, magazine, database, YouTube, podcast)</h2>
<p>Most interview citations involve at least one container. Common containers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Magazine or newspaper name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Podcast series title</strong></li>
<li><strong>YouTube channel name</strong></li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> (if accessed through a library database)</li>
</ul>
<p>In MLA 9, you cite the interview and then the container details, such as site name, publisher, date, and URL.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you found an interview on a website that is reposting it from somewhere else, cite the version you actually used. If the repost is incomplete or untrustworthy, look for the original.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-4-interviews-without-a-clear-title">
<h2 >Special case 4, interviews without a clear title</h2>
<p>Many interviews do not have a formal title, especially audio or video interviews. MLA lets you supply a descriptive title in plain language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put a supplied title in quotation marks.</li>
<li>Keep it short and specific, such as “Interview with Jordan Alvarez” rather than “Interview.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this rule matters:</strong> A descriptive title helps readers identify the exact item, especially when a podcast contains many interviews or a channel posts many similar videos.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-5-interviews-with-multiple-people-panels-roundtables-co-hosts">
<h2 >Special case 5, interviews with multiple people (panels, roundtables, co-hosts)</h2>
<p>Interviews can involve multiple interviewees, multiple interviewers, or both. Your author rules become important here.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are <strong>two authors</strong> for the interview source (for example, two interviewers credited as authors of the article), list both, first inverted, second in normal order, joined by <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li>If there are <strong>three or more authors</strong>, list the first author inverted, then <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>If there is <strong>no author</strong>, start with the title.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> People often list everyone who appears in the interview as authors. MLA does not require that. Focus on the credited creator of the source you used, and name key participants in the description if needed.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-case-6-interviews-cited-from-a-transcript-versus-audio-or-video">
<h2 >Special case 6, interviews cited from a transcript versus audio or video</h2>
<p>Sometimes you used a transcript, not the recording. Cite what you actually consulted.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the transcript is a webpage or PDF, cite it like a web source or document.</li>
<li>If the transcript is part of a podcast page, the podcast page is the container.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this rule matters:</strong> A transcript can differ from the recording due to edits, corrections, or missing segments. Your citation should match the version you relied on.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-personal-interview-you-conducted-unpublished">
<h2 >Example 1, personal interview you conducted (unpublished)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong><br />
Nguyen, Lien. Interview. 12 Mar. 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way:</strong><br />
- <strong>Nguyen, Lien</strong> is the interviewee, listed with the first name in full and the first author inverted.<br />
- <strong>Interview</strong> functions as the title element because there is no published title.<br />
- The <strong>date</strong> documents when the information was given.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tips and pitfalls:</strong><br />
- Tip: Add a format label only if it helps, such as “Zoom interview.”<br />
- Pitfall: Do not invent a publisher or location. Personal interviews are not published sources.</p>

- The interview has no clear headline, so a <strong>supplied descriptive title</strong> appears in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>City Arts Review</em> is the <strong>container</strong> (the website).<br />
- The date and URL help readers retrieve the exact page.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tips and pitfalls:</strong><br />
- Tip: Use the page’s publication date, not the date you accessed it, unless your instructor requires an access date.<br />
- Pitfall: Do not shorten first names to initials. Use full first names as required.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-3-interview-in-a-podcast-episode-audio-container-with-episode-title">
<h2 >Example 3, interview in a podcast episode (audio container with episode title)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry (correct formatting):</strong><br />
Patel, Anika. “The Future of Urban Water, Interview with Samuel Reed.” <em>The Policy Lab Podcast</em>, hosted by Carmen Ellis, 19 Feb. 2023, Apple Podcasts, podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-policy-lab-podcast/id1234567890.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way:</strong><br />
- <strong>Patel, Anika</strong> is listed as the author because the episode is credited to Patel as the creator of that episode. If your platform instead credits the show generally, you might start with the episode title and treat it as no author.<br />
- The <strong>episode title</strong> is in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>The Policy Lab Podcast</em> is the <strong>container</strong> (the series).<br />
- “hosted by Carmen Ellis” clarifies a key contributor when relevant.<br />
- The platform and URL help readers locate it.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tips and pitfalls:</strong><br />
- Tip: If there are multiple containers (for example, a podcast on a website and also on Spotify), cite the one you used.<br />
- Pitfall: Do not list every guest, host, producer, and sponsor as authors. Use the credited author or start with the title if none is credited.</p>

<h2 >Common pitfalls checklist (quick, practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wrong person as author:</strong> Use the credited creator of the interview source, or the interviewee for interviews you conducted.</li>
<li><strong>Missing container details:</strong> For online, audio, and video interviews, the container is often the key to finding the item.</li>
<li><strong>No stable title:</strong> Supply a short descriptive title in quotation marks.</li>
<li><strong>Initials instead of full first names:</strong> Use full first names as required.</li>
<li><strong>Overcrowded author lists:</strong> Follow the two-author and et al. rules, and keep the entry readable.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-interviews-specifically">
<h2 >Why these rules matter in interviews specifically</h2>
<p>Interviews are easy to miscite because they often lack standard publication markers, and they can appear in many formats. MLA’s structure, especially author choice and container details, protects your credibility. It shows exactly what you used, who is responsible for it, and how a reader could locate it. That clarity is the main purpose of interview edge case rules.</p>
<p>If you tell me what kind of interview you are citing (personal, website, podcast, YouTube, or database), and who is credited on the source, I can format a Works Cited entry and an in-text citation that matches your exact case.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-personal-interview-i-conducted-in-mla-works-cited-and-in-text-citations">How do I cite a personal interview I conducted in MLA Works Cited and in-text citations?</h3>
<p>For an interview you conducted yourself, MLA treats it as personal communication. In the Works Cited, start with the interviewee’s name, then the descriptor “Interview,” then the date. Example: Smith, Jordan. Interview. 12 Mar. 2025. In your paper, use an in-text citation with the interviewee’s last name: (Smith). If you mention the person in the sentence, you can omit the parenthetical: Smith explained that…. Add context in the prose, such as the interview format (phone, Zoom, email) if it helps readers, but MLA does not require the medium for a personal interview entry. If your instructor wants more detail, you can add “Personal interview” after the name. For official guidance and examples, see MLA’s interview recommendations at the MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/citing-interviews/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-interview-i-found-online-like-a-youtube-interview-or-a-podcast-episode-in-mla">How do I cite an interview I found online, like a YouTube interview or a podcast episode, in MLA?</h3>
<p>Cite the interview as the container you accessed. For YouTube, start with the interview title in quotation marks, then the site name (YouTube), the channel or uploader, the upload date, and the URL. Include the interviewee and interviewer in the entry if they are central, often in the title or in a “By” or “Interview by” element when available. For podcasts, cite the episode title, the podcast name, the host, the production company if listed, the date, and the URL. In-text citations usually use the first element of the Works Cited entry, often the episode or video title shortened. If you quote a specific moment, add a time range in your prose, for example at 12:34. More examples are available from the MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/citing-podcasts/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-youtube-videos/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-put-the-interviewer-or-the-interviewee-first-in-an-mla-interview-citation">Do I put the interviewer or the interviewee first in an MLA interview citation?</h3>
<p>It depends on what you are citing and what your source emphasizes. For an interview you conducted, you usually begin with the interviewee because they are the source of the information: Lastname, Firstname. Interview. Date. For a published interview, begin with the person most responsible for the piece as it appears in the source. If the interview is presented as an article written by an interviewer, you may start with the interviewer as the author of the article, then include “Interview with” and the interviewee in the title or description. If the interview is clearly labeled as featuring the interviewee, you can start with the interviewee and treat the publication as the container. Check how the source credits authorship. MLA’s guidance on interviews and the core elements helps you decide: https://style.mla.org/citing-interviews/ and https://style.mla.org/mla-core-elements/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-email-interview-or-a-dm-interview-in-mla-and-do-i-need-to-include-the-message-text">How do I cite an email interview or a DM interview in MLA, and do I need to include the message text?</h3>
<p>Email and direct message interviews are usually cited as personal communication, similar to a personal interview. In Works Cited, list the sender (your interviewee), then a description like “Email interview” or “Message to the author,” then the date. Example: Patel, Rina. Email interview. 8 Oct. 2024. In-text citations use the sender’s last name: (Patel). You do not include the full message text in the citation, and you generally do not need to reproduce the entire exchange unless your assignment requires an appendix. If the platform matters for clarity, you can specify it in the description, such as “Instagram direct message interview.” Keep privacy in mind, ask permission if quoting sensitive material. For MLA guidance on emails and messages, see: https://style.mla.org/citing-email/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-interview-that-is-quoted-inside-another-source-like-a-news-article-that-includes-interview-quotes">How do I cite an interview that is quoted inside another source, like a news article that includes interview quotes?</h3>
<p>If you did not access the original interview and only read quotes within a news article, cite the news article, not the interview as a standalone source. In your prose, make it clear that the information is reported by the article, for example: In Nguyen’s article, Lopez says…. Your Works Cited entry should be for the article, and your in-text citation should point to the article’s author and page number or location if available: (Nguyen A4) or (Nguyen). Avoid treating the interviewee as the author unless the interview itself is the primary published item you consulted. If you want to emphasize the interviewee’s words, quote them, but still cite the container you actually used. MLA’s advice on indirect sources can help: https://style.mla.org/citing-indirect-sources/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-handle-missing-details-like-no-date-or-no-interviewer-name-when-citing-an-interview-in-mla">How do I handle missing details, like no date or no interviewer name, when citing an interview in MLA?</h3>
<p>MLA allows you to omit elements you cannot find, but you should still provide enough information for readers to locate the source. If there is no date for an online interview, leave it out and include an access date if your instructor requests it or if the content is likely to change. If the interviewer is not named, do not invent one, cite the source as it is credited, often by title and site. If the interview has no clear title, you can create a descriptive label in plain text, such as Interview with Firstname Lastname, then include the container information. For in-text citations, use the first element of your Works Cited entry, often a shortened title. When uncertain, apply MLA’s core elements in order and include what you have: https://style.mla.org/mla-core-elements/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-interviews/.</p>
