<section class="content-section" id="what-an-mla-9-new-york-times-citation-looks-like">
<h2 >What an MLA 9 New York Times citation looks like</h2>
<p>In MLA 9th edition, a New York Times article is usually cited as a work on a website. The core pieces you include are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of the article</strong> (in quotation marks)</li>
<li><strong>Title of the website</strong> (italicized, usually <em>The New York Times</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong> (often omitted for <em>The New York Times</em> because the site name and publisher are the same)</li>
<li><strong>Publication date</strong></li>
<li><strong>URL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong> (optional, but recommended if the page is likely to change or if no date is available)</li>
</ul>
<p>A standard Works Cited entry for a New York Times web article often follows this pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Article." <em>The New York Times</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>MLA is designed to help readers find your source quickly and to show, clearly and consistently, where your information came from.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules, and why they matter</h2>
<p>Your rules about author names affect the first element of the citation, which is crucial because Works Cited entries are alphabetized by that first element.</p>
<h3 id="use-full-first-names-not-initials">Use full first names, not initials</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Author names must use full first names, not initials.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Full first names reduce confusion between authors with similar initials, and they make your citations more respectful and readable. Even if a byline uses an initial, your guide requires expanding it to a full first name when you can verify it.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you cannot confidently find the author’s full first name from a reliable source, do not guess. In that case, follow your course or instructor guidance. Your stated rule prioritizes full first names, but accuracy comes first.</p>
<h3 id="invert-the-first-authors-name">Invert the first author’s name</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> The first author must be inverted, Last, First Middle.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Inversion supports alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list. If every entry begins consistently, readers can scan the list faster.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong><br />
- Correct: <strong>Smith, John Michael.</strong><br />
- Incorrect: <strong>John Michael Smith.</strong></p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors, use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For two authors, use “and” between names. Only the first author is inverted.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA uses “and” to keep citations readable and consistent with standard prose. Keeping the second author in normal order also prevents awkward, repetitive inversion.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong><br />
<strong>Last, First Middle, and First Last.</strong></p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">Three or more authors, use “et al.” after the first author only</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> For three or more authors, list the first author (inverted), then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list additional authors before et al.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It keeps long author lists from overwhelming the citation while still giving clear credit and a stable alphabetizing element.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong><br />
<strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> If there is no author, begin with the title. Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA treats the title as the main identifying element when no author is provided. This preserves consistency and still lets readers locate the source.</p>
<p><strong>Alphabetizing tip:</strong> When alphabetizing in the Works Cited list, ignore leading articles like <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, and <strong>The</strong>. For example, “The Summer…” would be alphabetized under <strong>S</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="title-rules-for-new-york-times-items">
<h2 >Title rules for New York Times items</h2>
<h3 id="article-title-goes-in-quotation-marks">Article title goes in quotation marks</h3>
<p>New York Times articles are typically individual web pages, so the article title is treated as a short work.</p>
<p><strong>Example formatting:</strong><br />
- “How Heat Waves Are Changing Summer Travel”</p>
<h3 id="website-title-is-italicized">Website title is italicized</h3>
<p>The container, the website, is italicized.</p>
<p><strong>Example formatting:</strong><br />
- <em>The New York Times</em></p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="date-rules-and-formatting">
<h2 >Date rules and formatting</h2>
<p>MLA prefers dates in <strong>Day Month Year</strong> format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct: <strong>12 Oct. 2024</strong> (MLA often abbreviates months)</li>
<li>Also acceptable in many MLA guides: <strong>12 October 2024</strong> (if you choose not to abbreviate, be consistent)</li>
</ul>
<p>A New York Times page may show a publication date and sometimes an updated date. In MLA, you generally cite the publication date shown for the article. If an updated date is clearly labeled and is more relevant to what you used, you can cite that date instead, but be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> Use the date that appears on the article page itself, not the date you found it on social media or in a search result.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="url-rules">
<h2 >URL rules</h2>
<p>Include the URL without “https://” only if your instructor prefers that, but MLA 9 commonly allows the full URL. Do not underline it. Do not add a period if it could confuse the link, but MLA style typically ends the citation with a period. If you are concerned about link copying, you can end with the URL and then a period, most readers can still use it.</p>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Use the stable article URL. Avoid tracking links or long redirect URLs.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="when-to-include-an-access-date">
<h2 >When to include an access date</h2>
<p>MLA 9 says access dates are optional, but they are useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article has no clear publication date.</li>
<li>The content is likely to change.</li>
<li>You are using a version that may update.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Access date format:</strong><br />
<strong>Accessed 15 Nov. 2025.</strong></p>

<h2 >Examples with correct formatting and detailed explanations</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-one-author-most-common">
<h2 >Example 1, one author (most common)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>Garcia, Maria Elena. “Inside the Race to Build Safer Batteries.” <em>The New York Times</em>, 18 Sept. 2025, https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/safer-batteries.html.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- <strong>Garcia, Maria Elena.</strong> The author is first, and the first author name is inverted.<br />
- <strong>“Inside the Race to Build Safer Batteries.”</strong> The article title is in quotation marks.<br />
- <strong><em>The New York Times</em>,</strong> The website name is the container and is italicized.<br />
- <strong>18 Sept. 2025,</strong> Date is in Day Month Year format.<br />
- <strong>URL</strong> is included at the end to help the reader locate the article quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Writing the author as “M. E. Garcia.” Your rule requires full first names, and MLA also prefers clarity.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">
<h2 >Example 2, two authors (use “and,” second author not inverted)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>Chen, David Andrew, and Priya Desai. “What Cities Are Doing to Reduce Flood Risk.” <em>The New York Times</em>, 6 May 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/06/climate/cities-flood-risk.html.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- <strong>First author inverted:</strong> Chen, David Andrew<br />
- <strong>Second author normal order:</strong> Priya Desai, not “Desai, Priya”<br />
- <strong>“and”</strong> connects the two authors, which matches MLA expectations and your rule.<br />
- The rest follows the standard article pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid:</strong> Using an ampersand, like “Chen, David Andrew, and Desai, Priya.” MLA uses “and,” and only the first name is inverted in a two author entry.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-start-with-title">
<h2 >Example 3, no author (start with title)</h2>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry:</strong></p>
<p>“After the Storm, a Town Rebuilds Slowly.” <em>The New York Times</em>, 22 Aug. 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/us/town-rebuilds-storm.html.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong><br />
- No author is listed, so the citation begins with the <strong>title</strong> in quotation marks.<br />
- The entry still includes the container, date, and URL, so the reader can find the source easily.<br />
- You do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.,” which MLA does not require and your rules prohibit.</p>
<p><strong>Alphabetizing reminder:</strong> When alphabetizing Works Cited, ignore leading articles. If the title began with “The,” you would alphabetize by the next important word.</p>

<p>MLA formatting is not just decoration. It creates a predictable pattern. When the first author is inverted, and when titles and containers are consistently formatted, readers can locate sources faster.</p>
<h3 id="they-support-credibility-and-fairness">They support credibility and fairness</h3>
<p>Using full first names, when possible, helps distinguish authors and avoids reducing people to initials. It also aligns with the goal of giving clear credit.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-and-common-pitfalls">
<h2 >Practical tips and common pitfalls</h2>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copy the article title carefully</strong> and keep the capitalization as shown on the page. MLA uses title case for English titles in most student writing contexts, but many instructors accept copying the exact headline capitalization. Choose one approach and stay consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Use the article page, not a search preview,</strong> to get the correct date and title.</li>
<li><strong>Check for paywall or app links.</strong> If you are using a New York Times app link, try to find the standard web URL so others can access it more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent with month style,</strong> either abbreviate months (Sept., Oct., Nov.) or spell them out, but do not switch back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Putting <em>The New York Times</em> in quotation marks.</strong> It should be italicized as the container.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting to invert the first author.</strong> This breaks Works Cited alphabetizing.</li>
<li><strong>Listing all authors for three or more.</strong> Your rule requires first author plus et al.</li>
<li><strong>Using “n.d.”</strong> MLA does not require it, and your rules prohibit it. If there is no date, omit it and consider adding an access date instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, share one specific New York Times URL you are citing, and I can format the exact MLA 9 Works Cited entry using your author name rules.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your The New York Times citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-new-york-times-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes New York Times citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing <em>The New York Times</em> in MLA 9 is usually straightforward, but several special cases come up often because the newspaper publishes in print, on the web, in apps, and through subscriber-only pages. MLA 9 is flexible, but that flexibility means you must make consistent choices and record details carefully.</p>
<p>Two ideas help in almost every edge case:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cite what you actually used.</strong> If you read the article on the website, cite the web version. If you used a PDF scan that shows print page numbers, you can cite that version.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize the “core elements” in the correct order.</strong> Author. “Title of source.” <em>Title of container</em>, other contributors, version, number, publisher, publication date, location.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your rules about names also matter a lot for <em>The New York Times</em> because NYT stories frequently have multiple contributors, newsroom bylines, or no clear author at all.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-with-authors-and-bylines">
<h2 >Special cases with authors and bylines</h2>
<h3 id="one-author-with-a-standard-byline">One author with a standard byline</h3>
<p>Use the author’s full first name, then follow MLA’s inverted first-author format.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Works Cited entries are alphabetized by the first element, usually the author’s last name. Inverting the first author keeps your list consistent and easy to scan.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors">Two authors</h3>
<p>List both authors, first author inverted, second author in normal order. Use <strong>and</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Inverting both names. Only the first author is inverted.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors">Three or more authors</h3>
<p>List the first author inverted, then add <strong>et al.</strong> Do not list the other authors.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing all authors, or writing “and others” instead of <strong>et al.</strong></p>
<h3 id="by-the-new-york-times-or-newsroom-bylines">“By The New York Times” or newsroom bylines</h3>
<p>Sometimes the byline is an organization (for example, “By The New York Times,” “By The Editorial Board,” or “By The Associated Press”). MLA allows a corporate author. Use the name as it appears.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the byline is “The Associated Press,” treat that as the author. If there is no author at all, start with the title.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-shown">No author shown</h3>
<p>If no author is credited, begin the entry with the article title in quotation marks. For alphabetizing, ignore A, An, and The, but keep “The” in the title itself.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MLA does not want you to invent an author, and it does not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.” for missing information.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-updates-and-time-stamps">
<h2 >Dates, updates, and time stamps</h2>
<h3 id="updated-articles">Updated articles</h3>
<p>NYT articles are often updated after publication. You might see “Published” and “Updated” times.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the page clearly shows an <strong>updated date</strong> and your use depends on the updated content, cite the <strong>updated date</strong>.</li>
<li>If you are discussing the original publication context, cite the <strong>original publication date</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If both appear, you can cite the date that best matches your use. MLA usually expects one date in the Works Cited entry, not a full history.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-news-with-only-a-time">Breaking news with only a time</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will see a time stamp and a date. Use the date. MLA citations typically do not need the time unless it is essential to your point.</p>
<h3 id="todays-paper-versus-web-publication-date">“Today’s Paper” versus web publication date</h3>
<p>NYT pages sometimes reference “Today’s Paper,” which can mislead you into using the print issue date rather than the web publication date. Prefer the date shown on the specific article page you read.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="urls-paywalls-and-share-links">
<h2 >URLs, paywalls, and “Share” links</h2>
<h3 id="paywalled-pages">Paywalled pages</h3>
<p>A paywall does not change the citation format. You still cite the article normally, including the URL if you accessed it online.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Omitting the URL because it is behind a paywall. MLA 9 generally encourages including URLs for online works, especially for newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="short-share-links-versus-full-urls">Short “share” links versus full URLs</h3>
<p>NYT often provides a shorter link, sometimes with tracking parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer a <strong>clean, stable URL</strong> when possible.</li>
<li>Remove long tracking strings when they are clearly unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If the short link reliably leads to the article, it is acceptable. Consistency matters more than perfection.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="print-versus-online-and-when-page-numbers-matter">
<h2 >Print versus online, and when page numbers matter</h2>
<h3 id="online-articles">Online articles</h3>
<p>Most students cite the online version. Online NYT articles usually do not have page numbers, so you do not include them.</p>
<h3 id="print-articles-pdfs-and-page-numbers">Print articles, PDFs, and page numbers</h3>
<p>If you used a print copy or a PDF that shows the print layout, include the page number in the “location” element, for example, p. A1 or pp. A1, A6.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Page numbers help readers find the exact article in print archives, and they show you used a print-based version.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="containers-and-sections-when-to-include-them">
<h2 >Containers and sections, when to include them</h2>
<p>In MLA, <em>The New York Times</em> is the container. The section (for example, “U.S.,” “World,” “Opinion”) is usually not required in Works Cited entries. You can mention the section in your paper if it supports your discussion, but it is not typically a citation element.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Treating “U.S.” or “Opinion” as the container instead of <em>The New York Times</em>. The newspaper is the container.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="interactive-and-nonstandard-nyt-items">
<h2 >Interactive and nonstandard NYT items</h2>
<h3 id="opinion-pieces-editorials-and-guest-essays">Opinion pieces, editorials, and guest essays</h3>
<p>These often have clear authors. Cite them like any other article.</p>
<p>If the author is “The Editorial Board,” that is a corporate author. Use it exactly, then the title.</p>
<h3 id="live-briefings-and-rolling-updates">Live briefings and rolling updates</h3>
<p>These pages can behave like continuously updated posts. Use the date shown for the briefing page. If the page is updated frequently and you are worried it will change, consider including an access date. MLA makes access dates optional, but they can be helpful for live pages.</p>
<h3 id="multimedia-on-nyt-such-as-videos-and-podcasts">Multimedia on NYT, such as videos and podcasts</h3>
<p>NYT hosts videos, audio, and interactive graphics. The container is still <em>The New York Times</em>, but the “title of source” is the video or audio segment title. You may also have a contributor like a director, host, or narrator.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you are citing a NYT podcast episode page, do not cite it as a newspaper article. Cite it as an audio work on a website, still using <em>The New York Times</em> as the container if that is where it is hosted.</p>

<h3 id="example-1-standard-online-article-with-one-author">Example 1, Standard online article with one author</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Smith, John Michael. “City Council Approves New Housing Plan.” <em>The New York Times</em>, 12 Mar. 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/12/nyregion/housing-plan-city-council.html.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The author uses a <strong>full first name</strong> and is <strong>inverted</strong> because it is the first element.<br />
- The article title is in <strong>quotation marks</strong> because it is a short work within a larger container.<br />
- <em>The New York Times</em> is <strong>italicized</strong> as the container.<br />
- The date is in MLA’s day month year format.<br />
- The URL is included because it is an online newspaper article.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Writing “J. M. Smith” instead of “John Michael Smith.”<br />
- Italicizing the article title instead of putting it in quotation marks.<br />
- Leaving off the container, which would make the entry unclear.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-two-authors-second-author-not-inverted">Example 2, Two authors (second author not inverted)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Garcia, Maria Elena, and Thomas Andrew Lee. “How Heat Waves Are Reshaping Summer Travel.” <em>The New York Times</em>, 8 July 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/travel/heat-waves-summer-travel.html.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- First author is <strong>inverted</strong>: Garcia, Maria Elena.<br />
- Second author is <strong>not inverted</strong>: Thomas Andrew Lee.<br />
- “and” connects the two authors, as MLA prefers.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Writing “Lee, Thomas Andrew” for the second author.<br />
- Using an ampersand, or using “et al.” for only two authors.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-listed-start-with-title">Example 3, No author listed (start with title)</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>

<p>“A New Push to Regulate Artificial Intelligence.” <em>The New York Times</em>, 19 Sept. 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/technology/ai-regulation-policy.html.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- No author is credited, so the entry starts with the <strong>title</strong>.<br />
- The title stays in quotation marks, and <em>The New York Times</em> remains the italicized container.<br />
- You do not insert “Anonymous,” and you do not add “n.d.”</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls to avoid</strong><br />
- Starting with <em>The New York Times</em> as if it were the author when no author is provided.<br />
- Inventing an author or using a username.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-for-getting-nyt-citations-right">
<h2 >Practical tips for getting NYT citations right</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copy the title carefully.</strong> NYT headlines can include colons and quotation marks. Keep the capitalization and punctuation as shown on the page.</li>
<li><strong>Use the article page, not a search results page.</strong> Search pages and topic hubs can have different titles and unstable URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Check the byline line.</strong> NYT sometimes lists multiple contributors in a way that is easy to miss.</li>
<li><strong>Choose a stable URL.</strong> Remove obvious tracking parameters when possible.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent about versions.</strong> If you cite some NYT items as print and others as web, that is fine, but each entry should match the version you actually used.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter">
<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<p>These details are not just formatting. They help readers locate the exact NYT item you used, and they show academic care. Correct author handling respects identity and avoids confusion between writers with similar last names. Correct containers and dates make your sources verifiable, which strengthens your credibility and makes your research easier to follow.</p>
<p>If you want, paste one or two NYT links you are using, and I can format them in MLA 9 using your author-name rules, including any tricky bylines or update dates.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-new-york-times-article-in-mla-9-for-a-works-cited-entry">How do I cite a New York Times article in MLA 9 for a Works Cited entry?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, cite a New York Times article like a web newspaper article. Use this basic order: Author Last Name, First Name. "Title of Article." The New York Times, Day Month Year, URL. End with a period. If there is no author, start with the article title. If you accessed it through the NYT website, you usually do not need a database name. Include the full URL without https:// if your instructor prefers shorter links, but keep it stable and accurate. Example scenario: you are citing a news report you read online for a research paper, so you include the date on the article and the direct article link. MLA guidance on works cited entries is here: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and MLA rules for web sources are here: https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-new-york-times-article-i-found-in-a-database-like-proquest-or-gale">How do I cite a New York Times article I found in a database like ProQuest or Gale?</h3>
<p>If you accessed The New York Times through a library database, MLA 9 treats the database as a container. Start with the author and article title, then include The New York Times, the publication date, and any page numbers if provided. After that, add the database name in italics and the DOI or stable URL. Format: Author. "Article Title." The New York Times, Day Month Year, p. A1. Database Name, URL. Practical scenario: you found a 1998 article in ProQuest, the database shows page A12, and it provides a stable link. Include the page because it helps readers locate the print equivalent. Include the database link if it is stable. For MLA container guidance, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and database discussion at https://style.mla.org/citing-database-articles/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-new-york-times-article-has-no-author-listed-or-it-is-credited-to-the-associated-press">What if the New York Times article has no author listed, or it is credited to The Associated Press?</h3>
<p>If no author is listed, begin the Works Cited entry with the article title in quotation marks. Then list The New York Times, the date, and the URL. If the article is credited to a news service like The Associated Press, use that as the author. Example scenario: you are citing a breaking news brief that lists no byline, so you start with the title. Another scenario: a sports recap says “By The Associated Press,” so you cite: The Associated Press. "Title." The New York Times, Day Month Year, URL. In your in-text citation, use a shortened title in quotation marks when there is no author, for example ("Title Keywords"). MLA guidance on unknown authors is summarized here: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-the-new-york-times-especially-if-there-are-multiple-authors-or-no-page-numbers">How do I do in-text citations for The New York Times, especially if there are multiple authors or no page numbers?</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations usually use the author’s last name and a page number, but online NYT articles often have no page numbers. In that case, use only the author’s last name in parentheses, for example (Smith). If there are two authors, include both last names, for example (Smith and Lee). For three or more authors, use the first author’s last name followed by et al., for example (Smith et al.). If there is no author, use a shortened version of the article title in quotation marks, for example ("Climate Policy"). Practical scenario: you quote a paragraph from an NYT opinion column online, you cite (Goldberg) and make sure the Works Cited entry matches. MLA in-text rules are here: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-new-york-times-opinion-piece-editorial-or-letter-to-the-editor-in-mla-9">How do I cite a New York Times opinion piece, editorial, or letter to the editor in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Opinion content is cited like other articles, but be careful to use the correct title and author, and label the type only if it helps clarify what you used. Format: Author. "Title." The New York Times, Day Month Year, URL. If it is an editorial with no individual author, start with the title. Practical scenario: you cite an unsigned editorial, so the title becomes the first element. If you cite a letter to the editor, the letter writer is the author, and the title may be the letter title as shown on the page. If the page lists a section like “Opinion,” you can include it as the location, but it is not required. For MLA guidance on citing articles and web pages, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-new-york-times-article-i-read-in-print-and-how-do-i-handle-page-numbers-like-a1">How do I cite a New York Times article I read in print, and how do I handle page numbers like A1?</h3>
<p>For a print New York Times article, include the print details and page number. Format: Author. "Title of Article." The New York Times, Day Month Year, p. A1. Use p. for one page and pp. for a range, for example pp. A1, A12. The lettered page numbers are normal for newspapers, include them exactly as printed. Practical scenario: you used a print copy in a library, the article begins on A1 and continues on A12, so you list pp. A1, A12. Your in-text citation should include the author and the page, for example (Smith A1). If there is no author, use a shortened title and the page, for example ("Title Keywords" A1).
