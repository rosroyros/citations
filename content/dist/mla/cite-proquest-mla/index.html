<section class="content-section" id="what-proquest-is-and-why-it-matters-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What ProQuest Is and Why It Matters in MLA 9</h2>
<p>ProQuest is not a “source type” by itself. It is a database that hosts many kinds of sources, such as journal articles, newspaper articles, dissertations, and reports. In MLA 9, you cite the work you used (for example, a journal article), then you add the database information because you accessed it through ProQuest.</p>
<p>This matters because MLA 9 is built around the idea of “containers.” The original work is the first container (the journal, newspaper, or dissertation). The database is often the second container (ProQuest). Including the database helps readers locate the exact version you used, especially when the same item appears in multiple places.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-structure-for-proquest-database-items">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 Structure for ProQuest Database Items</h2>
<p>Most ProQuest citations follow this pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Source.” <em>Title of Container,</em> other contributors (if needed), version (if needed), number (if needed), publisher (if needed), date, location. <em>Title of Second Container (Database),</em> location (URL or DOI). Accessed date (optional).</strong></p>
<p>In practice, you will usually use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of the article or item</strong></li>
<li><strong>Title of the journal, newspaper, or dissertation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Volume, issue, date, pages</strong> (as available)</li>
<li><strong>ProQuest</strong> (the database name, italicized)</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong> (or a stable link provided by ProQuest)</li>
<li><strong>Accessed date</strong> (optional, but often helpful for databases)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-you-must-follow-based-on-your-requirements">
<h2 >Author Rules You Must Follow (Based on Your Requirements)</h2>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>Use the author’s full first name whenever possible. This improves clarity and respects the author’s identity. For example, use “Taylor, James” instead of “Taylor, J.”</p>
<h3 id="first-author-is-always-inverted">First author is always inverted</h3>
<p>The first author appears as: <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>. This supports alphabetical ordering in Works Cited.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p>Format: <strong>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</strong></p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author-only">Three or more authors use “et al.” after the first author only</h3>
<p>Format: <strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong><br />
Do not list the other authors before “et al.”</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p>If there is no author, begin with the title of the work. For alphabetizing, ignore <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, and <strong>The</strong>, but keep them in the citation itself.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-to-use-for-the-location-in-a-proquest-citation">
<h2 >What to Use for the “Location” in a ProQuest Citation</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, the “location” is usually <strong>page numbers</strong> for print style containers, and a <strong>URL or DOI</strong> for online access. With ProQuest, you will often have both.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the item has page numbers in the journal or newspaper PDF, include them.</li>
<li>Then include the database and a link.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="which-link-should-you-use">Which link should you use</h3>
<p>Use one of the following, in this order of preference:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DOI</strong> (if available), because it is stable.</li>
<li><strong>A stable URL</strong> provided by ProQuest.</li>
<li>If ProQuest only gives a long session based link, use the most stable option available, often labeled as a permalink, stable URL, or document URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Avoid copying a link that stops working when you log out. If your link looks extremely long and includes session information, it may not be stable.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-is-formatted-this-way">Why this is formatted this way</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Garcia, Maria Elena</strong> is inverted because it is the first author in an MLA Works Cited entry.</li>
<li>The article title is in <strong>quotation marks</strong> because it is a part of a larger work.</li>
<li>The journal title is in <strong>italics</strong> because it is the container.</li>
<li>Volume, issue, year, and page range identify the specific journal publication.</li>
<li><strong>ProQuest</strong> is italicized as the second container.</li>
<li>The ProQuest link is the final location so a reader can retrieve the item.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>If ProQuest provides a PDF and also an HTML view, use the citation details from the PDF when possible. PDFs often show the official page numbers, which are useful in MLA.</p>

<li>The date is written in MLA style, day month year.</li>
<li>The page is included because newspapers often have page identifiers, especially in PDF format.</li>
<li>ProQuest is added as the database container, followed by the link.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-pitfall">Common pitfall</h3>
<p>Do not invert the second author in a two author entry. This is one of the most frequent formatting errors. Correct is “Nguyen, Linh, and David Ramirez,” not “Nguyen, Linh, and Ramirez, David.”</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="practical-tip">Practical tip</h3>
<p>Before using “no author,” double check the PDF first pages, the ProQuest citation tool, and the detailed record view. Dissertations almost always have an author, but the name can be hidden depending on which screen you are viewing.</p>

<h2 >Practical Tips for Building ProQuest Citations</h2>
<h3 id="use-proquest-metadata-but-verify-it">Use ProQuest metadata, but verify it</h3>
<p>ProQuest often provides a pre made citation, but it may not match your requirements. Check:<br />
- Full first names instead of initials<br />
- Correct capitalization of titles<br />
- Correct container title and date<br />
- Stable URL</p>
<h3 id="prefer-the-pdf-for-page-numbers">Prefer the PDF for page numbers</h3>
<p>If MLA style expects pages and the PDF provides them, include them. Page numbers are still useful even when you accessed the item online.</p>
<h3 id="include-an-access-date-when-content-is-likely-to-change">Include an access date when content is likely to change</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but for databases, an access date can be helpful. Use it when the record might change, or when the link is behind a login.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Proquest citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-proquest-citations-special-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes ProQuest citations “special” in MLA 9</h2>
<p>ProQuest is usually not the original publisher of what you are citing. It is an access platform and database that hosts copies of articles, dissertations, reports, newspapers, and other materials. In MLA 9, you still cite the original work first, then you add the database information as a “second container.” This is where most edge cases happen.</p>
<p>A reliable way to think about it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what the item is, article, dissertation, report, book chapter, news story, etc.  </li>
<li>Build the MLA citation for that item as if you found it in its original place.  </li>
<li>Add ProQuest as the database container, plus a stable link or an identifier such as a document number.  </li>
<li>Add an access date only when it helps readers retrieve the item, or when your instructor requires it.</li>
</ol>
<p>These rules matter because MLA is designed to help readers locate the same source you used. ProQuest records can change, links can be session based, and the same text can appear in multiple databases. If you describe the original source clearly and then specify ProQuest as the access point, your Works Cited entry stays accurate and usable.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-name-edge-cases-in-proquest-records">
<h2 >Author name edge cases in ProQuest records</h2>
<h3 id="full-first-names-not-initials">Full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>ProQuest metadata sometimes displays initials, even when a full name exists elsewhere. Under your rule set, you should use full first names whenever you can verify them from the item itself, such as the PDF title page, the article header, or the dissertation front matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>If ProQuest shows “J. Smith” but the PDF shows “Jordan Smith,” use “Smith, Jordan.”</li>
<li>If you cannot find the full first name anywhere in the document, you have a decision to make. The safest academic practice is to avoid inventing a name. Use what is verifiable. If your assignment requires full first names, check the author’s university profile, ORCID, or the journal’s website, then use the full name only if you can confirm it is the same person.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-authors-versus-three-or-more">Two authors versus three or more</h3>
<p>ProQuest often lists many contributors, editors, translators, and corporate authors. Make sure you are counting actual authors of the work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: Invert only the first author, then use normal order for the second, with “and.”</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: Use the first author only, inverted, then add “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-author-in-the-proquest-record">No author in the ProQuest record</h3>
<p>Some ProQuest items, especially newswire items, market reports, and unsigned newspaper pieces, truly have no author. In that case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the title.  </li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous” or “n.d.”  </li>
<li>Alphabetize by the title, ignoring A, An, and The.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="container-confusion-journal-title-versus-proquest">
<h2 >Container confusion: journal title versus ProQuest</h2>
<h3 id="the-second-container-is-the-database">The “second container” is the database</h3>
<p>In MLA, a container is the larger whole that holds the source. Many ProQuest items have two containers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First container</strong>: the journal, newspaper, book, conference proceedings, or dissertation series.  </li>
<li><strong>Second container</strong>: ProQuest.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common pitfall is to treat ProQuest as the only container and omit the journal or newspaper title. That makes the citation weaker because it hides the original publication context.</p>
<h3 id="when-there-is-only-one-container">When there is only one container</h3>
<p>Sometimes ProQuest hosts a PDF report that is not clearly part of a journal or periodical. In that case, ProQuest may be the only container you can name, but you should still include any publisher, sponsoring organization, or series that appears on the document itself.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="urls-dois-and-proquest-identifiers">
<h2 >URLs, DOIs, and ProQuest identifiers</h2>
<h3 id="prefer-a-doi-when-it-exists">Prefer a DOI when it exists</h3>
<p>If the article has a DOI, use it. A DOI is more stable than many ProQuest links.</p>
<h3 id="proquest-links-can-be-unstable">ProQuest links can be unstable</h3>
<p>ProQuest often generates session based URLs that break for other users. Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “Document URL” that appears stable, or  </li>
<li>A “ProQuest document ID,” sometimes shown as a number in the record, or  </li>
<li>A permalink option, depending on your library interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot get a stable link, you can still cite ProQuest as the database and include whatever stable identifier ProQuest provides. Your goal is retrievability for a reader with ProQuest access.</p>
<h3 id="access-dates">Access dates</h3>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but they can be helpful for database content that changes, or when the link is not stable. If your instructor or program expects access dates for database sources, include one.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="publication-date-problems-and-advance-online-issues">
<h2 >Publication date problems and “advance online” issues</h2>
<h3 id="multiple-dates-in-the-proquest-record">Multiple dates in the ProQuest record</h3>
<p>ProQuest can show an online posting date, an issue date, and a copyright year. MLA typically uses the publication date of the version you consulted. For journal articles, that is usually the issue date. If the article is “ahead of print” and has no issue information, use the date shown for the online publication.</p>
<h3 id="missing-dates">Missing dates</h3>
<p>If there is no date anywhere in the ProQuest record or the PDF, omit the date rather than inserting “n.d.” Under your rules, you should not add “n.d.” The entry remains valid, although less specific.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="page-numbers-article-numbers-and-transcripts">
<h2 >Page numbers, article numbers, and transcripts</h2>
<h3 id="page-numbers-that-do-not-match-the-pdf">Page numbers that do not match the PDF</h3>
<p>ProQuest sometimes lists page ranges that reflect the print version, while the PDF uses different pagination, or no pagination. Use what is most authoritative for the version you used.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the PDF is a scan of print pages, use those page numbers.  </li>
<li>If it is HTML text with no pages, omit page numbers.  </li>
<li>If the journal uses an article number instead of pages, include that if it is clearly labeled.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transcripts-and-wire-stories">Transcripts and wire stories</h3>
<p>Transcripts, press releases, and wire stories often lack page numbers and sometimes lack clear publishers. In those cases, focus on title, program or service name, date, and ProQuest as the database.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dissertations-and-theses-on-proquest-common-special-cases">
<h2 >Dissertations and theses on ProQuest: common special cases</h2>
<p>Dissertations and theses are one of the most common ProQuest source types. Special issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The degree type and institution must be included, usually in the description element.  </li>
<li>ProQuest often provides a publication number. That can be useful as an identifier.  </li>
<li>Some dissertations are later published as books. Make sure you are citing the dissertation version you actually used.</li>

<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Lopez, Maria Elena, and Daniel Robert Kim. “Community Health Workers and Vaccine Confidence in Rural Clinics.” <em>Journal of Public Health Practice</em>, vol. 18, no. 2, 2021, pp. 145-162. <em>ProQuest</em>, https://www.proquest.com/docview/2654321987.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this format is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Names</strong>: The first author is inverted, “Lopez, Maria Elena,” and the second author is normal order, “Daniel Robert Kim.” Full first names are used.<br />
- <strong>Title</strong>: The article title is in quotation marks.<br />
- <strong>First container</strong>: The journal title is italicized, with volume, issue, year, and pages.<br />
- <strong>Second container</strong>: ProQuest is italicized as the database. A ProQuest document link is included to help retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not write “Lopez, M. E.” or “Kim, D. R.” if you can confirm full names. Also do not drop the journal title and cite only ProQuest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this format is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>Author</strong>: First author name inverted, full first name used.<br />
- <strong>Title</strong>: The dissertation title is italicized because it is a standalone work.<br />
- <strong>Date</strong>: The year is included.<br />
- <strong>Description</strong>: “University of Michigan, PhD dissertation” clarifies what the work is.<br />
- <strong>Database details</strong>: The database name is included, then ProQuest, then the publication number as a stable identifier.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not treat the dissertation like a journal article. Also do not rely only on a long session based URL if a publication number is available.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this format is correct</strong><br />
- <strong>No author</strong>: The entry begins with the title in quotation marks.<br />
- <strong>Newspaper container</strong>: The newspaper name is italicized, followed by date and page.<br />
- <strong>Database container</strong>: ProQuest is listed as the second container with a retrieval link.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Do not insert “Anonymous” as an author. Also do not start with “The Boston Globe” if there is no author, unless your instructor prefers starting with the newspaper for news items. Under your rules, “NO AUTHOR” means you start with the title.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-journal-article-i-found-on-proquest-in-mla-9">How do I cite a journal article I found on ProQuest in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Treat ProQuest as the database, not the publisher. Start your Works Cited entry with the article details, then add the database information at the end. A typical format is: Author. "Article Title." Journal Title, vol., no., year, pp. page range. ProQuest, URL or DOI. Accessed Day Mon. Year. Use the stable URL from ProQuest when possible, and remove any session specific parts if the link breaks. Include an access date if your instructor asks, or if the content is likely to change. In your in text citation, use the author last name and page number from the PDF, for example (Nguyen 42). If there are no page numbers, use the author only. For MLA database guidance, see MLA Works Cited: A Quick Guide, https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-have-to-include-the-proquest-url-or-can-i-just-cite-the-journals-doi">Do I have to include the ProQuest URL, or can I just cite the journal’s DOI?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, a DOI is usually preferred because it is designed to be stable. If the article has a DOI, include it in the location element, for example https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx, and you can omit the ProQuest URL. If there is no DOI, use the stable ProQuest link instead. Avoid copying a long URL that contains temporary session information, it often stops working. If you are citing a PDF you downloaded from ProQuest, still cite it as an article from a database, and include the DOI or a stable URL so a reader can locate it. A practical approach is to check the article record for a DOI, then fall back to a stable ProQuest URL if needed. For MLA rules on URLs and DOIs, see https://style.mla.org/dois-and-urls/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-proquest-dissertation-or-thesis-in-mla-9">How do I cite a ProQuest dissertation or thesis in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Cite the dissertation or thesis as a standalone work, then list ProQuest as the database where you accessed it. Include the author, the title in italics, the type of work, the university, and the year. Then add ProQuest Dissertations and Theses as the database name, followed by the URL. If ProQuest provides a publication number, you can include it as an optional element after the title or near the database information if it helps identification. Example pattern: Author. Title. Dissertation, University, Year. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, URL. Accessed Day Mon. Year. In text, cite the author and page number from the PDF if available. This is especially useful when you quote a specific section from a long dissertation. For more on MLA container formatting, see https://style.mla.org/containers/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-my-proquest-source-has-no-page-numbers-like-an-html-article-or-a-report">What if my ProQuest source has no page numbers, like an HTML article or a report?</h3>
<p>If there are no stable page numbers, do not invent them. For in text citations, use the author’s last name alone, for example (Patel). If the work is long and you need more precision, you can cite a chapter title, section heading, or paragraph number if the source provides them consistently. In your Works Cited entry, include all the usual elements you can find, such as author, title, publication or sponsoring organization, date, and then ProQuest as the database with a stable URL. A common scenario is an HTML version of an article where the PDF has pages but the HTML does not. If you can access the PDF, cite and quote from it so your page references match what your reader can find. For MLA in text citation options, see https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-newspaper-article-from-proquest-and-do-i-list-proquest-or-the-newspaper-as-the-publisher">How do I cite a newspaper article from ProQuest, and do I list ProQuest or the newspaper as the publisher?</h3>
<p>List the newspaper as the source, and ProQuest as the database container. In MLA 9, you generally do not treat ProQuest as the publisher. A standard entry looks like: Author. "Article Title." Newspaper Name, Day Mon. Year, p. A1. ProQuest, URL. If the article appears on multiple pages, include the page range when available. If you accessed a historical newspaper through ProQuest, keep the original publication date and newspaper title as they appear in the record. ProQuest is simply how you retrieved it. In text, cite the author and page if you have it, for example (Garcia A1). If there is no author, use a shortened title in quotation marks. For MLA guidance on citing news sources, see https://style.mla.org/how-to-cite-a-newspaper-article/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="my-professor-says-not-to-cite-databases-so-should-i-leave-proquest-out-of-my-works-cited-entry">My professor says not to cite databases, so should I leave ProQuest out of my Works Cited entry?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 generally recommends including the database when you accessed the work through one, because it helps readers locate the source you used. Some instructors or departments prefer you to omit database names or URLs, especially if the item is easily found elsewhere. If you are told to omit ProQuest, keep the core citation for the original source, such as the journal, newspaper, or book, and include a DOI if available. If you omit ProQuest, do not replace it with vague wording like "online." A practical scenario is a peer reviewed article with a DOI, you can cite the journal and DOI without naming ProQuest. When instructions conflict, follow your professor’s rules and be consistent across your paper. For MLA’s general Works Cited principles, see https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
