<h2 >What an MLA 9 book citation is for</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a book citation in your Works Cited list gives readers enough information to find the exact book you used. It also shows academic honesty by making it clear which ideas came from your source. MLA’s format is consistent on purpose. When every citation follows the same pattern, your reader can quickly scan for the author, title, and publication details.</p>
<p>MLA book citations usually follow this order:</p>
<p><strong>Author. <em>Title of Book</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>That is the basic structure, but real books often include details like multiple authors, editors, editions, volumes, or translations. MLA provides a consistent way to include those details without making the citation confusing.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="the-core-format-for-a-book-the-template">
<h2 >The core format for a book (the template)</h2>
<p>Use this as your starting point:</p>
<p><strong>Author Last Name, First Middle. <em>Title of Book</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<h3 id="key-formatting-rules">Key formatting rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author name</strong></li>
<li>Use the author’s <strong>full first name</strong>, not initials.</li>
<li>The <strong>first author</strong> is always inverted: <strong>Last, First Middle</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong></li>
<li>Italicize the <strong>full book title</strong>.</li>
<li>Capitalize major words in the title (title case).</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong></li>
<li>List the publisher’s name as it appears on the title page.</li>
<li><strong>Year</strong></li>
<li>Use the publication year.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-including-your-required-rules">
<h2 >Author rules (including your required rules)</h2>
<h3 id="one-author">One author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Format: <strong>Last, First Middle.</strong></li>
<li>Use full first name, not initials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example pattern:<br />
- <strong>Nguyen, Andrew Michael.</strong></p>
<p>Why this matters: MLA citations are alphabetized by the first element, usually the author’s last name. Inverting the first author’s name makes Works Cited entries easy to sort and scan.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-required-rule">Two authors (required rule)</h3>
<ul>
<li>First author is inverted.</li>
<li>Second author is in normal order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>and</strong> between names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, and First Middle Last.</strong></p>
<p>Why this matters: This rule keeps alphabetizing consistent while still presenting the second author’s name naturally and clearly.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-required-rule">Three or more authors (required rule)</h3>
<ul>
<li>List only the first author (inverted, full first name).</li>
<li>Then add <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li>Do not list additional authors before et al.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<p>Why this matters: Many academic books have long author lists. Using et al. keeps citations readable while still crediting the group.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-required-rule">No author (required rule)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with the <strong>title</strong> of the book.</li>
<li>Do not use “Anonymous.”</li>
<li>Do not use “n.d.”</li>
<li>For alphabetizing, ignore <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, and <strong>The</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- <strong><em>Title of Book</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>Why this matters: When there is no author, the title becomes the best identifier. MLA relies on the first element for alphabetizing, so the title takes that role.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-to-include-after-the-title-common-book-details">
<h2 >What to include after the title (common book details)</h2>
<h3 id="edition-if-it-is-not-the-first">Edition (if it is not the first)</h3>
<p>If the book is labeled “2nd edition,” “Revised edition,” or similar, include it after the title.</p>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- <strong>Author. <em>Title</em>. 2nd ed., Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<h3 id="volume-number-if-the-book-is-part-of-a-multivolume-set">Volume number (if the book is part of a multivolume set)</h3>
<p>Include the volume number after the title or after the edition if both appear.</p>
<p>Pattern:<br />
- <strong>Author. <em>Title</em>. Vol. 2, Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<h3 id="editors-or-translators-when-relevant">Editors or translators (when relevant)</h3>
<p>If your book is primarily identified by an editor or translator, or you want to emphasize them, MLA allows you to include that role.</p>
<p>Common pattern when an editor is central:<br />
- <strong>Editor Last, First Middle, editor. <em>Title</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>If you cite a book by an author but also want to note a translator:<br />
- <strong>Author. <em>Title</em>. Translated by First Last, Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>Practical tip: Only add roles like editor or translator when they help identify the version you used or when the editor or translator is important to your discussion.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Book Citation Mla citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="overview-what-counts-as-a-special-case-in-an-mla-book-citation">
<h2 >Overview, what counts as a “special case” in an MLA book citation</h2>
<p>In MLA 9, a basic book entry usually looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Last, First Middle. <em>Title of Book</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>Special cases happen when one or more of those parts is missing, unclear, or needs extra detail for readers to find the exact version you used. Edge cases also happen when a book has unusual authorship (editors, translators, organizations), unusual publication facts (multiple publishers, no date), or you used a specific version (edition, volume, e-book platform).</p>
<p>Your rules about author names matter because MLA citations are designed to help readers locate the source quickly in a Works Cited list. Inverting the first author supports alphabetizing. Using full first names avoids confusion between authors with similar initials.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-edge-cases">
<h2 >Author edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="two-authors-full-names-correct-order">Two authors, full names, correct order</h3>
<p>For two authors, MLA uses both names, with the first author inverted and the second in normal order. Use <strong>and</strong> between names. This matters because it keeps the Works Cited alphabetized by the first author’s last name, while still showing both authors clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, and First Last. <em>Title</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Inverting the second author, which MLA does not do.<br />
- Using initials, which your rules prohibit.<br />
- Using an ampersand, MLA prefers <strong>and</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author">Three or more authors, use et al. after the first author</h3>
<p>For three or more authors, list only the first author, then add <strong>et al.</strong> This avoids long citations while still pointing to the main entry under the first author’s surname.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, et al. <em>Title</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Listing the first two or three authors before et al.<br />
- Writing “and others” instead of <strong>et al.</strong><br />
- Forgetting the period after <strong>al.</strong></p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p>If no author is credited, start the Works Cited entry with the title. This matters because MLA does not want you to invent an author name like “Anonymous,” and it keeps citations honest and traceable.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
- <strong><em>Title of Book</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
For alphabetizing, ignore <strong>A</strong>, <strong>An</strong>, and <strong>The</strong> when deciding where it falls in the list. You still write the title normally in the entry.</p>
<h3 id="organization-as-author">Organization as author</h3>
<p>Sometimes a book is written by a group, agency, or corporation. In that case, the organization functions as the author. Use the full official name as shown on the title page.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
- <strong>Organization Name. <em>Title</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Treating the organization as the publisher when it is clearly the author.<br />
- Abbreviating the organization name when the book uses the full name.</p>
<h3 id="editors-or-translators-instead-of-an-author">Editors or translators instead of an author</h3>
<p>If a book is primarily credited to an editor or translator, put that person in the author position and add their role. This matters because it tells readers what kind of responsibility that person had for the text.</p>
<p><strong>Format examples</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, editor. <em>Title</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, translator. <em>Title</em>. Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p>If there is an author and you also need to name an editor or translator, the editor or translator usually appears after the title.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Listing the editor as the author when the book clearly has a named author.<br />
- Omitting the role label, like editor or translator.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="title-and-edition-edge-cases">
<h2 >Title and edition edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="titles-within-titles">Titles within titles</h3>
<p>If the book title includes the title of another work, keep MLA title formatting consistent. The overall book title stays italicized. A shorter work inside it may appear in quotation marks, depending on how it is presented in the book itself.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
Follow the title page wording and punctuation closely. MLA values what is printed on the source.</p>
<h3 id="editions-revised-versions-and-numbered-editions">Editions, revised versions, and numbered editions</h3>
<p>If you used a specific edition, include it after the title. This matters because page numbers, chapters, and even content can change between editions.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle. <em>Title</em>. 2nd ed., Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Leaving out the edition when you used a non-first edition.<br />
- Confusing a printing with an edition. “Second printing” is not the same as “2nd edition.”</p>
<h3 id="multivolume-works">Multivolume works</h3>
<p>If the work has multiple volumes and you used the whole set, include the total number of volumes. If you used a specific volume, name the volume number.</p>
<p><strong>Whole set format</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle. <em>Title</em>. Vols. 1-3, Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Single volume format</strong><br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle. <em>Title</em>. Vol. 2, Publisher, Year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If your in-text citation needs to point to a specific volume and page, you can use something like <strong>(LastName 2 145)</strong> to mean volume 2, page 145.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="publication-details-edge-cases">
<h2 >Publication details edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="multiple-publishers-imprints-and-university-presses">Multiple publishers, imprints, and university presses</h3>
<p>MLA 9 generally uses the publisher as shown on the title page. If there are multiple publishers, include the one most responsible for the edition you used, or list both if they are presented as co-publishers.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Listing the place of publication, MLA 9 usually does not require it for books.<br />
- Confusing an imprint with the publisher. If the imprint is what the book presents as the publisher, use it.</p>
<h3 id="no-date-or-unclear-date">No date or unclear date</h3>
<p>MLA prefers a year. If a book truly has no date, do not use “n.d.” under your rules. Instead, use whatever date information you can verify from the book itself, like a copyright year. If there is genuinely no date anywhere in the book, you may omit the date, but this is rare for books.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
Check the title page and the copyright page. Many books show the year only on the copyright page.</p>
<h3 id="republished-and-reprinted-books-original-year-vs-edition-year">Republished and reprinted books, original year vs. edition year</h3>
<p>If you used a modern reprint of an older book, cite the version you actually used, meaning the publisher and year of that edition. If the original year is important to your discussion, you can mention it in your writing, not necessarily in the Works Cited entry.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Citing the original publication year as if it were the edition you consulted.<br />
- Mixing details from different editions.</p>

<h2 >Format and punctuation edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="capitalization-and-italics">Capitalization and italics</h3>
<p>Book titles are italicized in MLA. Use title case, meaning capitalize major words. This matters because consistent formatting helps readers scan your Works Cited page quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong><br />
- Putting the book title in quotation marks, which is for shorter works like articles or chapters.<br />
- Forgetting italics.</p>
<h3 id="long-subtitles-and-punctuation">Long subtitles and punctuation</h3>
<p>Keep the subtitle after a colon exactly as it appears on the title page. MLA uses periods to separate the main parts of the citation. Do not replace MLA punctuation with your own style.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
Build the citation in “chunks,” author, title, edition if needed, publisher, year. Then check that each chunk ends correctly.</p>

<h2 >Examples with detailed explanations</h2>
<h3 id="example-1-two-authors-full-names-second-author-not-inverted">Example 1, two authors, full names, second author not inverted</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />
Smith, Jordan Michael, and Taylor Rebecca Nguyen. <em>Reading Cities, Writing Lives</em>. Riverstone Press, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, <strong>Smith, Jordan Michael</strong>, which supports alphabetizing by Smith.<br />
- The second author is in normal order, <strong>Taylor Rebecca Nguyen</strong>, which matches MLA rules for two authors.<br />
- The title is italicized because it is a complete book.<br />
- Publisher and year are included in the standard MLA order.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid</strong><br />
Do not write: “Nguyen, Taylor Rebecca” for the second author. MLA does not invert the second author in a two-author book.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Example 2, three or more authors, use et al.</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />
Garcia, Elena Marisol, et al. <em>Principles of Coastal Ecology</em>. Seabright Academic, 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- Only the first author is listed, with full first name and inverted order.<br />
- <strong>et al.</strong> replaces the remaining authors, which is MLA’s rule for three or more authors.<br />
- This keeps the entry readable while still crediting the team.</p>
<p><strong>Common mistake to avoid</strong><br />
Do not list multiple authors and then add et al. Under your rules, it should be first author only, then et al.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-start-with-the-title">Example 3, no author, start with the title</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />
<em>Handbook of Community Mediation</em>. Northlake Publishing, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- No author is invented, and “Anonymous” is not used.<br />
- The book title moves into the author position, which is MLA’s approach when no author is credited.<br />
- The title is italicized because it is a book.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
When alphabetizing, you ignore “A,” “An,” and “The,” but you still write the title normally in the entry.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-and-quick-tips-for-avoiding-errors">
<h2 >Why these rules matter, and quick tips for avoiding errors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readers need the exact version you used.</strong> Editions, volumes, and reprints can change page numbers and content.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabetizing must be consistent.</strong> Inverting the first author’s name is not just a style choice, it makes the Works Cited list functional.</li>
<li><strong>Full first names reduce confusion.</strong> They help distinguish authors with similar last names or initials.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quick-checklist">Quick checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Did you use <strong>full first names</strong>, not initials?</li>
<li>Is the <strong>first author inverted</strong>, every time?</li>
<li>For <strong>two authors</strong>, did you keep the second author in normal order and use <strong>and</strong>?</li>
<li>For <strong>three or more authors</strong>, did you use <strong>et al.</strong> after the first author only?</li>
<li>If there is <strong>no author</strong>, did you start with the <strong>italicized book title</strong> and avoid “n.d.” and “Anonymous”?</li>
<li>Is the <strong>book title italicized</strong>, with correct punctuation and a period at the end?</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-book-in-mla-9-for-my-works-cited-page">How do I cite a book in MLA 9 for my Works Cited page?</h3>
<p>For a standard book, MLA 9 uses this core format: Author Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Year. Example: Morrison, Toni. Beloved. Vintage, 2004. Italicize the book title, and end each major element with a period. If the book has a subtitle, include it after a colon, still italicized. If you used an ebook, you often add the platform or website and a URL or DOI at the end. If you are unsure what counts as the publisher, check the title page and copyright page, not the cover. For official guidance and more examples, see the MLA Style Center: https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/ and the Purdue OWL MLA Works Cited page: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_books.html</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-book-with-two-or-three-authors-in-mla-9">How do I cite a book with two or three authors in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>For two authors, list them in the order shown on the title page. The first author is Last, First, and the second author is First Last. Example: Gilbert, Sandra M., and Susan Gubar. The Madwoman in the Attic. Yale UP, 1979. For three or more authors, list the first author followed by et al. Example: Garcia, Maria, et al. Title of Book. Publisher, Year. In your in-text citation, you follow the same idea: (Gilbert and Gubar 42) for two authors, and (Garcia et al. 42) for three or more. If you need to mention all authors in prose, you can, but your Works Cited entry should still follow MLA rules. More details: https://style.mla.org/et-al-in-works-cited/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-chapter-or-essay-from-an-edited-book-in-mla-9">How do I cite a chapter or essay from an edited book in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>If you used a specific chapter, short story, or essay within a collection, cite the part you used, not just the whole book. Format: Author of Chapter. "Title of Chapter." Title of Book, edited by Editor Name, Publisher, Year, page range. Example: Walker, Alice. "Everyday Use." The Norton Anthology of American Literature, edited by Robert S. Levine, W. W. Norton, 2017, pp. 2450-59. In text, cite the chapter author and page number, not the editor: (Walker 2453). This is especially important when the book has many contributors and you only referenced one section. If the chapter is accessed through an online database, add the database name and a stable URL. MLA guidance: https://style.mla.org/citing-a-chapter-or-essay/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-is-the-correct-mla-in-text-citation-for-a-book-and-what-if-there-is-no-page-number">What is the correct MLA in-text citation for a book, and what if there is no page number?</h3>
<p>MLA in-text citations for books usually include the author’s last name and the page number, like this: (Morrison 62). If you name the author in your sentence, include only the page number in parentheses: Morrison argues that memory shapes identity (62). If you cite a source without page numbers, which is common with some ebooks, avoid inventing page numbers. Use other location information if it is stable, such as chapter, section, or paragraph numbers when available, for example: (Ng, ch. 3) or (Ng, par. 12). If the ebook has fixed page numbers that match a print edition, you can cite those pages. More guidance on in-text citations: https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-an-ebook-or-a-book-i-read-on-kindle-google-books-or-a-library-database-in-mla-9">How do I cite an ebook or a book I read on Kindle, Google Books, or a library database in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>Start with the same core book citation, then add details about the digital version. A common format is: Author. Title of Book. Publisher, Year. Name of Platform, URL or DOI. Example: Butler, Octavia E. Kindred. Beacon Press, 2003. Kindle edition. If you used Google Books, you might write: Author. Title. Publisher, Year. Google Books, URL. For a library database, include the database name and a stable link if your instructor allows it. If the URL is extremely long, use a permalink or DOI when possible. In-text citations should still point to pages if the ebook provides stable page numbers, otherwise use chapter or section info. More examples: https://style.mla.org/citing-an-e-book/</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-translated-book-or-a-book-with-an-editor-instead-of-an-author-in-mla-9">How do I cite a translated book or a book with an editor instead of an author in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>For a translated book, list the author first, then the title, then the translator. Example: Dostoevsky, Fyodor. Crime and Punishment. Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, Vintage, 1993. If the book is primarily credited to an editor, such as a collection of historical documents, begin with the editor and label the role. Example: Smith, John, editor. Title of Book. Publisher, Year. If you cite a classic work with multiple versions, include the translator or editor you actually used, because wording and page numbers can change across editions. In-text citations still use the first element of the Works Cited entry, usually the author or editor name, plus page numbers when available.
