<section class="content-section" id="what-wired-means-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What “Wired” means in MLA 9</h2>
<p>A <strong>Wired</strong> citation in MLA 9 usually refers to citing something you read on <strong>Wired.com</strong> or in <strong>Wired magazine’s online archive</strong>. In MLA terms, Wired is typically the <strong>container</strong>, meaning the website or magazine that hosts the article. Your goal is to help readers find the exact piece you used, and to give clear credit to the writer.</p>
<p>MLA 9 citations are built from a set of common elements, in a consistent order. You do not need a special “Wired format,” you follow the MLA 9 format for a <strong>web article</strong>, using Wired as the container.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-structure-for-a-wired-article">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 structure for a Wired article</h2>
<p>Use this general Works Cited pattern for a Wired article:</p>
<p><strong>Author. “Title of Article.” <em>Wired</em>, Publisher (optional), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year (optional).</strong></p>
<p>In MLA 9, you include as many of these elements as apply, and you keep the punctuation and formatting consistent.</p>
<h3 id="the-key-elements-explained-simply">The key elements, explained simply</h3>
<h4>1. Author</h4>
<p>MLA starts with the author when one is provided.</p>
<p>Your rules for author names matter here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use full first names, not initials.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invert only the first author</strong>: Last, First Middle.</li>
<li><strong>Two authors</strong>: first author inverted, second author normal order, joined with <strong>and</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors</strong>: list only the first author (inverted), then add <strong>et al.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No author</strong>: begin with the title instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules matter because MLA Works Cited lists are alphabetized. Inverting the first author makes sorting consistent, and full first names reduce confusion when multiple writers share a last name.</p>
<h4>2. Title of the article</h4>
<p>Put the article title in <strong>quotation marks</strong> because it is a shorter work within a larger container.</p>
<p>Example formatting:<br />
“Inside the Race to Build Better Batteries”</p>
<h4>3. Container (Wired)</h4>
<p>The container is the larger source that holds the article.</p>
<p>Format: <em>Wired</em> (italicized)</p>
<h4>4. Date</h4>
<p>Use the date Wired provides, usually near the top of the article.</p>
<p>MLA format: <strong>Day Month Year</strong><br />
Example: 15 Mar. 2024</p>
<p>If Wired only shows month and year, use what you have. Do not invent a day.</p>
<h4>5. URL</h4>
<p>Include the direct URL to the article. MLA 9 allows you to drop “https://” but it is also acceptable to include it. The most important thing is consistency.</p>
<h4>6. Access date (often optional)</h4>
<p>MLA 9 treats access dates as optional, but they are helpful when:<br />
- the page changes over time,<br />
- there is no clear publication date,<br />
- you are citing a page that updates frequently.</p>
<p>Format: Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Wired citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="special-cases">
<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
<h2>Special and edge cases when citing <em>Wired</em> in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing <em>Wired</em> looks simple at first, but real articles often include unusual bylines, changing URLs, paywalls, and content that is updated after publication. MLA 9 is designed to handle these situations consistently. The goal is clarity, so a reader can find the exact item you used, and fairness, so the creator receives proper credit.</p>
<p>Below are the most common special cases you will run into with <em>Wired</em>, along with practical tips and common pitfalls.</p>
<h2>Core pattern for a <em>Wired</em> web article</h2>
<p>Most <em>Wired</em> items you will cite are web pages. A typical Works Cited entry follows this pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Author. "Title of Article." <em>Wired</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p>Notes:<br />
- Article title is in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>Wired</em> is italicized.<br />
- Date is Day Month Year (example: 7 Oct. 2024).<br />
- Use the direct URL. MLA 9 prefers stable, specific links when available.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-name-edge-cases">
<h2 >Author name edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="one-author-full-first-name-required">One author, full first name required</h3>
<p>Your rules require full first names, not initials. That matters because it reduces ambiguity, especially when authors share last names or publish under similar bylines.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Copying a shortened byline (like “J. Smith”) from a site or database.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> If <em>Wired</em> shows the full name on the page, use it. If the page only shows initials, check the author profile page on <em>Wired</em> and use the full name if it is clearly the same person.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-second-name-not-inverted">Two authors, second name not inverted</h3>
<p>MLA uses inversion only for the first author so the entry alphabetizes correctly. Your rules also require “and” between two authors.</p>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, and First Last.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Inverting both authors, or using an ampersand.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the second author in normal order.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Three or more authors, use “et al.”</h3>
<p>For long author lists, MLA simplifies. Your rules require only the first author, then “et al.” Do not list the second and third authors before “et al.”</p>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Last, First Middle, et al.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Listing all authors, or listing two then “et al.”<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Use exactly one author name, then “et al.” when there are three or more.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-listed">No author listed</h3>
<p>Sometimes <em>Wired</em> content, especially staff pages, interactive features, or announcements, may not list an author. In that case, start with the title.</p>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>"Title of Page." <em>Wired</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Writing “Anonymous” or “n.d.”<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> If no author is shown, do not invent one. Start with the title, and include the date if present.</p>
<h3 id="corporate-or-group-authors">Corporate or group authors</h3>
<p>Occasionally, content may be credited to a group such as “Wired Staff” or a named project team. MLA allows the group name as the author.</p>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Wired Staff. "Title." <em>Wired</em>, Day Month Year, URL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Treating a group author as “no author.”<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> If a group name is clearly presented as the creator, use it as the author.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="date-and-update-edge-cases">
<h2 >Date and update edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="published-vs-updated-dates">“Published” vs “updated” dates</h3>
<p><em>Wired</em> articles are sometimes updated after publication. MLA 9 generally uses the date that best identifies the version you consulted. If the page clearly lists an update date and your reading depends on updated information, use the update date.</p>
<p><strong>Practical approach:</strong><br />
- If the page shows only one date, use it.<br />
- If it shows “Updated” and that matters, cite the updated date.<br />
- If both appear and you want extra clarity, you can include the date shown on the page that corresponds to the version you used. MLA does not require you to label it “updated” in the citation, but you should be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Guessing dates or using the date you accessed as a substitute for publication date.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Access dates are optional in MLA 9 and are best used when content is likely to change, or when no date is provided.</p>
<h3 id="no-date-provided">No date provided</h3>
<p>Some pages do not show a clear publication date. MLA 9 lets you omit the date rather than inserting “n.d.”</p>
<p>Format:<br />
- <strong>Author. "Title." <em>Wired</em>, URL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Adding “n.d.”<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Leave the date out if it is not available.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="url-paywall-and-database-edge-cases">
<h2 >URL, paywall, and database edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="long-urls-tracking-and-amp-pages">Long URLs, tracking, and “amp” pages</h3>
<p><em>Wired</em> links may include tracking parameters or mobile versions. MLA wants a usable URL, not a cluttered one.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Remove obvious tracking pieces (often starting with <code>?</code> and including things like <code>utm_source</code>). Keep the core page URL that still works.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Copying a “share” link that redirects through a tracking service.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Prefer the canonical URL shown in the browser address bar after the page fully loads.</p>
<h3>Citing <em>Wired</em> through a library database</h3>
<p>If you accessed the article through a database (for example, ProQuest or EBSCO), you may have a database permalink rather than the <em>Wired</em> URL. MLA allows citing the database version. The container becomes the database, not <em>Wired</em> alone.</p>
<p>However, many <em>Wired</em> magazine pieces exist both as a web page and as a magazine issue PDF or database text. Choose the version you actually used.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Mixing elements from the website and the database, for example using the <em>Wired</em> URL but the database’s publication details.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Decide which version you consulted, then build the citation around that container.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-and-content-type-edge-cases">
<h2 >Titles and content type edge cases</h2>
<h3 id="series-labels-section-headers-and-subtitles">Series labels, section headers, and subtitles</h3>
<p><em>Wired</em> sometimes displays a label like “Security” or “Gear” above the title. That label is usually a section, not part of the title. Use the article’s actual headline as the title.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Including the section name as if it were part of the title.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Use the exact headline text, including a subtitle if it is part of the headline.</p>
<h3 id="non-article-pages-videos-and-interactive-features">Non article pages, videos, and interactive features</h3>
<p>If the content is not a standard article, you still follow MLA’s core idea, identify the main creator (if any), the title of the page or feature, the site name <em>Wired</em>, the date, and the URL. If it is a video hosted on <em>Wired</em> or embedded from another platform, you may need to cite the original host as the container instead.</p>
<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Citing a YouTube video as if it were a <em>Wired</em> article just because it is embedded on <em>Wired</em>.<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Cite the source that actually hosts the video, unless <em>Wired</em> is clearly the publisher and host.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="examples-with-explanations">
<h2 >Examples with explanations</h2>
<h3>Example 1, two authors, standard <em>Wired</em> web article</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Thompson, Clive, and Lauren Goode. "How AI Assistants Are Changing Everyday Work." <em>Wired</em>, 12 Sept. 2024, https://www.wired.com/story/how-ai-assistants-are-changing-everyday-work/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- The first author is inverted, “Thompson, Clive.”<br />
- The second author is not inverted and is joined with “and,” “Lauren Goode.”<br />
- The article title is in quotation marks.<br />
- <em>Wired</em> is the container and is italicized.<br />
- The date uses MLA’s Day Month Year format.<br />
- The URL is a direct link to the article.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Writing “Goode, Lauren” for the second author. Only the first author is inverted.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-three-or-more-authors-use-et-al">Example 2, three or more authors, use “et al.”</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>Patel, Nitasha Tiku, et al. "Inside the Race to Regulate Artificial Intelligence." <em>Wired</em>, 3 May 2025, https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-race-to-regulate-artificial-intelligence/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- There are three or more authors, so only the first author is listed.<br />
- The first author is inverted and uses a full first name.<br />
- “et al.” replaces the remaining authors, which keeps the entry readable and consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Listing two authors and then “et al.” Your rule is first author only, then “et al.”</p>
<h3 id="example-3-no-author-start-with-the-title">Example 3, no author, start with the title</h3>
<p><strong>Works Cited entry</strong></p>
<blockquote class="citation-example">
<p>"The Best Laptops for Students in 2025." <em>Wired</em>, 8 Aug. 2025, https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-laptops-for-students/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this is correct</strong><br />
- No author is credited, so the citation begins with the title.<br />
- The title is in quotation marks because it is a page within a website.<br />
- <em>Wired</em> remains the container.<br />
- The date and URL help readers find the exact page.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall to avoid</strong><br />
- Adding “Anonymous” or “n.d.” MLA 9 does not require either, and your rules prohibit them.</p>

<h2 >Why these rules matter</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alphabetizing and consistency:</strong> Inverting only the first author makes Works Cited lists easy to scan and sort.</li>
<li><strong>Accurate credit:</strong> Full first names reduce confusion and better represent the author’s identity.</li>
<li><strong>Retrievability:</strong> Clean URLs and correct containers help readers locate the same source, even when content is syndicated or republished.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Handling updates and missing information honestly builds credibility. It shows you are not guessing.</li>
</ul>

<section class="content-section" id="practical-tips-and-quick-checklist">
<h2 >Practical tips and quick checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the byline and use full first names when available.</li>
<li>Invert only the first author, never the second in a two author entry.</li>
<li>Use “et al.” after the first author for three or more authors.</li>
<li>If there is no author, start with the title, do not use “Anonymous.”</li>
<li>Prefer the clean, direct <em>Wired</em> URL without tracking parameters.</li>
<li>Use the date shown on the page, omit the date if none is given.</li>
<li>Add an access date only when the page is likely to change or lacks a date.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, paste a specific <em>Wired</em> link and tell me whether you read it on the <em>Wired</em> site or through a database, and I will format the exact MLA 9 Works Cited entry using your author rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-wired-article-in-mla-9-for-my-works-cited-page">How do I cite a Wired article in MLA 9 for my Works Cited page?</h3>
<p>For a standard Wired web article, use this MLA 9 structure, Author Last, First. "Title of Article." Wired, Publisher (often Condé Nast), Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year (optional but recommended if the page changes). Example scenario, you used a Wired piece about AI policy for a research paper. Your entry might look like, Smith, Jane. "Inside the New AI Rules." Wired, 12 Oct. 2024, https://www.wired.com/story/example/. If no author is listed, start with the article title. If no date is shown, omit it and consider adding an access date. Do not include "https://" only if your instructor prefers shortened URLs, otherwise keep the full URL. For more guidance, see the MLA Works Cited basics, https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-an-in-text-citation-for-a-wired-article-if-there-are-no-page-numbers">How do I do an in-text citation for a Wired article if there are no page numbers?</h3>
<p>Most Wired articles are read online and do not have stable page numbers, so MLA 9 typically uses the author name in parentheses, not a page number. Example scenario, you quote a sentence from a Wired article by Aarian Marshall. Your in-text citation would be (Marshall). If you mention the author in your sentence, you can omit the parenthetical name, Marshall argues that the policy will reshape procurement. If there is no author, use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks, for example ("Inside the New AI Rules"). Avoid using paragraph numbers unless your instructor specifically requests them, MLA does not require them. If you cite multiple Wired sources with the same author, add a shortened title to distinguish them, (Marshall, "Title"). More on MLA in-text citations, https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations-the-basics/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-wired-article-with-no-author-or-an-organization-name">How do I cite a Wired article with no author or an organization name?</h3>
<p>If a Wired page has no listed author, MLA 9 tells you to begin the Works Cited entry with the article title in quotation marks. Then list Wired as the container, followed by the date and URL. Example scenario, you are citing a short news update or a staff post where no byline appears. Your entry might start, "Title of Article." Wired, 5 May 2025, https://www.wired.com/story/example/. If the author is an organization, which is less common for Wired, you can use the organization as the author, but only if it is clearly credited as the creator. In text, cite the shortened title if there is no author, for example ("Title of Article"). MLA guidance on unknown authors, https://style.mla.org/citing-works-with-unknown-authors/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-wired-podcast-episode-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Wired podcast episode in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>To cite a Wired podcast episode, treat the episode as the source and the podcast series as the container. A common MLA 9 format is, "Episode Title." Podcast Name, hosted by Host Name, produced by Wired, Day Month Year, URL. If there is a credited narrator or guest you are emphasizing, you can include them after the title with a descriptor. Example scenario, you reference a Wired podcast episode about cybersecurity trends, and you quote a guest. Your Works Cited entry should still focus on the episode, while your in-text citation usually uses the episode title in quotation marks if no single author is clear. If the platform is Spotify or Apple Podcasts, you can include the platform as the container if it helps readers locate it, but the URL is often enough. MLA audio guidance, https://style.mla.org/citing-audio/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-wired-video-or-youtube-clip-in-mla-9">How do I cite a Wired video or YouTube clip in MLA 9?</h3>
<p>If the Wired video is on YouTube, cite it as a YouTube video with Wired as the account name. MLA 9 format, "Video Title." YouTube, uploaded by Wired, Day Month Year, URL. Example scenario, you use a Wired "Autocomplete Interview" video in a media studies essay. Your Works Cited entry should include the exact video title, the site, the uploader, the date, and the link. In text, cite the first element, usually a shortened title in quotation marks, for example ("Video Title"). If the video is hosted directly on Wired.com, treat it like a web page and include any credited director or producer if listed, then Wired, date, and URL. More on citing online videos, https://style.mla.org/citing-videos/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="should-i-include-an-access-date-when-citing-wired-and-what-if-the-article-gets-updated">Should I include an access date when citing Wired, and what if the article gets updated?</h3>
<p>MLA 9 makes access dates optional, but they are useful for web sources that can change, which includes many Wired pages. Include an access date if you expect updates, if the page has no publication date, or if your instructor requires it. Example scenario, you cite a Wired "live" page tracking an unfolding tech lawsuit, and the content changes after you submit your paper. Add an access date at the end, Accessed 15 Nov. 2025. If Wired lists both a publication date and an updated date, cite the date that best matches what you used. If the page clearly labels an updated date, you can use it as the date in your entry. If you are worried about link rot, consider saving a PDF or using a permalink, but still cite the original URL. MLA web citation overview, https://style.mla.org/citing-web-pages/.</p>
