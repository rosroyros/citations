<h2 >How to Cite Reddit in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Citing Reddit in MLA 9 is very doable once you treat a Reddit post or comment like any other online text. MLA asks you to identify who created the content, what it is called, where it appears, when it was posted, and how to find it again. Reddit is a platform, so your citation usually includes both the specific post or comment and the site that hosts it.</p>
<p>Reddit citations matter because Reddit content can be edited, deleted, reposted, or copied to other places. A clear citation helps your reader locate the exact version you used, and it shows that you are using sources responsibly.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-you-are-usually-citing-on-reddit">
<h2 >What you are usually citing on Reddit</h2>
<p>You might cite:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A post (thread starter)</strong>: the original submission that begins a discussion.</li>
<li><strong>A comment</strong>: a reply within the thread.</li>
<li><strong>A whole discussion thread</strong>: sometimes you cite the post, and you refer to the comments in your writing, or you cite a specific comment if that is what you analyze.</li>
</ul>
<p>In MLA, you cite the specific unit you used. If you quote a comment, cite the comment. If you discuss the original post, cite the post.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-9-elements-for-a-reddit-citation">
<h2 >Core MLA 9 elements for a Reddit citation</h2>
<p>MLA 9 works best when you think in “containers.”</p>
<p><strong>Typical elements you will use:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Author</strong> (the Reddit user who posted)<br />
2. <strong>Title of source</strong> (the post title, or a description of the comment)<br />
3. <strong>Title of container</strong> (Reddit)<br />
4. <strong>Version</strong> (optional, not common for Reddit)<br />
5. <strong>Number</strong> (optional, not common for Reddit)<br />
6. <strong>Publisher</strong> (Reddit, Inc. is usually omitted for Reddit because the container title is enough for most web citations, but your instructor may prefer including it)<br />
7. <strong>Publication date</strong> (date and time if available)<br />
8. <strong>Location</strong> (URL)</p>
<p>You will not always have every element. MLA is flexible, but you should include what helps the reader find the source.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="author-rules-for-reddit-and-why-they-matter">
<h2 >Author rules for Reddit, and why they matter</h2>
<h3 id="use-full-first-names-not-initials">Use full first names, not initials</h3>
<p>Your rule set requires <strong>full first names</strong>. This matters because it improves clarity and avoids confusion when multiple people share similar names. It also respects identity by not reducing names to initials.</p>
<p><strong>Practical reality:</strong> Reddit usernames are often handles, not real names. MLA allows you to use the name shown. If a user profile provides a real name, you can use it. If not, you may have only the handle. When you only have a handle, you should use it as written, because you cannot invent a full name.</p>
<p>If your assignment requires full first names even for Reddit accounts, you will need a reliable source for that identity, such as the user’s verified website, a profile bio that clearly states the name, or a public statement. If you cannot verify it, do not guess.</p>
<h3 id="first-author-must-be-inverted">First author must be inverted</h3>
<p>MLA Works Cited entries are alphabetized, so the first author is inverted. This makes scanning and sorting easier.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong><br />
Last, First Middle.</p>
<h3 id="two-authors-use-and-second-author-not-inverted">Two authors use “and,” second author not inverted</h3>
<p>This keeps the entry readable while still fitting MLA’s alphabetizing system.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong><br />
Last, First Middle, and First Last.</p>
<h3 id="three-or-more-authors-use-et-al-after-the-first-author">Three or more authors use “et al.” after the first author</h3>
<p>This keeps long author lists from taking over the citation while still crediting the primary author listed.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong><br />
Last, First Middle, et al.</p>
<h3 id="no-author-start-with-the-title">No author, start with the title</h3>
<p>If there is no author, MLA begins with the title. This prevents “Anonymous” style placeholders that do not help readers locate the source.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="titles-on-reddit-how-to-format-them">
<h2 >Titles on Reddit, how to format them</h2>
<h3 id="post-titles">Post titles</h3>
<p>A Reddit post title is usually treated like a short work on a website, so it goes in <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
“Best Budget Laptops for College?”</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Comments usually do not have titles. In MLA, you can create a <strong>descriptive title</strong> in quotation marks, such as:<br />
- “Comment on ‘Best Budget Laptops for College?’”<br />
- Or you can quote the first few words of the comment as a title, if that is clearer.</p>
<p>The goal is to help the reader identify what you cited.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="dates-urls-and-access-dates">
<h2 >Dates, URLs, and access dates</h2>
<h3 id="date">Date</h3>
<p>Use the date Reddit provides. If a time stamp is visible, you can include it if it helps distinguish versions, especially in fast moving threads.</p>
<h3 id="url">URL</h3>
<p>Use the direct link to the post or comment. For comments, use the “permalink” or the URL that points to that specific comment.</p>
<h3 id="access-date">Access date</h3>
<p>MLA says access dates are optional, but they are often helpful for Reddit because content can change or disappear. Many instructors like them for social media and forums. If you include an access date, place it at the end.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-1-citing-a-reddit-post-single-author">
<h2 >Example 1, Citing a Reddit post (single author)</h2>
<h3 id="works-cited-format">Works Cited format</h3>
<p>Last, First Middle. “Title of Post.” <em>Reddit</em>, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Nguyen, Taylor Minh. “How Do You Stay Focused During Long Study Sessions?” <em>Reddit</em>, 14 Sept. 2024, https://www.reddit.com/r/studying/comments/xxxxx/how_do_you_stay_focused_during_long_study_sessions/. Accessed 3 Jan. 2026.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-works">Why this works</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong> is first and inverted, so it alphabetizes correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Post title</strong> is in quotation marks because it is a short work.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong> is italicized as the container.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong> helps locate the exact post and shows timeliness.</li>
<li><strong>Direct URL</strong> allows retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Access date</strong> acknowledges that Reddit can change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation">In-text citation</h3>
<p>For MLA in text citation, use the author element. If you have no page numbers, use the author only.</p>
<p>(Nguyen)</p>
<p>If you mention the author in the sentence, you do not need parentheses.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="example-2-citing-a-reddit-comment-no-comment-title">
<h2 >Example 2, Citing a Reddit comment (no comment title)</h2>

<h3 id="why-this-works">Why this works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Comments usually lack titles, so a <strong>descriptive title</strong> clearly identifies the source.</li>
<li>The citation still includes the <strong>container</strong> and a <strong>direct link</strong> to the comment, not just the main thread.</li>
<li>The date distinguishes the comment from others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-text-citation">In-text citation</h3>
<p>(Patel)</p>
<p>If you cite multiple Reddit sources by the same author, add a shortened title in the in text citation to avoid confusion.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="example-3-no-author-available-start-with-the-title">
<h2 >Example 3, No author available (start with the title)</h2>
<p>Sometimes a post is deleted or the author is not visible. If you truly have no author name to cite, start with the title.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-works">Why this works</h3>
<ul>
<li>MLA does not want you to invent an author.</li>
<li>Starting with the title keeps the entry usable and searchable.</li>
<li>The title is what your reader will see first on the page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-the-permalink-not-the-general-subreddit-link">Use the permalink, not the general subreddit link</h3>
<p>A subreddit homepage changes constantly. A permalink points to the exact post or comment you used.</p>
<h3 id="capture-the-date-carefully">Capture the date carefully</h3>
<p>Reddit may show relative time like “1 year ago.” If possible, click to reveal the exact date, or use the expanded timestamp if Reddit provides it.</p>
<h3 id="consider-saving-evidence-for-your-own-records">Consider saving evidence for your own records</h3>
<p>If your project depends heavily on Reddit, take a screenshot or save an archived link, if allowed by your instructor. This is not a replacement for citation, it is a backup.</p>
<h3 id="match-your-in-text-citations-to-your-works-cited-entries">Match your in-text citations to your Works Cited entries</h3>
<p>If your Works Cited entry begins with a title because there is no author, your in-text citation should also use a shortened title.</p>

<h2 >Common pitfalls to avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guessing a real name</strong> for a username. If you cannot verify it, do not invent it.</li>
<li><strong>Citing the subreddit instead of the post or comment.</strong> Cite the specific item you used.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting quotation marks</strong> around post titles and descriptive comment titles.</li>
<li><strong>Using a broken or shortened URL</strong> that does not lead to the exact content.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving out the date</strong> when it is available, dates are important for fast changing platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Mixing author rules.</strong> Keep the first author inverted, use “and” for two authors, and use “et al.” for three or more.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-academic-writing">
<h2 >Why these rules matter in academic writing</h2>
<p>MLA rules are not just formatting habits. They serve three practical goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Your reader can find the exact Reddit content you used.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Clear citations show you are not cherry picking or misrepresenting online discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Standard formatting makes your Works Cited list easy to scan, grade, and verify.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you tell me whether you are citing a post, a comment, or a whole thread, and whether you have a real name or only a username, I can format your exact MLA 9 citation using your author rules.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="validation-checklist">
<h2 >Validation Checklist</h2>
<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Reddit citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author names MUST use full first names, not initials. In MLA 9, the emphasis is on full names to provide clarity and respect for the author's identity. The first author's name is inverted (Last, First Middle), while subsequent authors in two-author works use normal order (First Last).</li>
<li>First author name MUST be inverted (Last, First Middle). This applies to all source types and is the standard opening format for MLA citations. The inversion facilitates alphabetical ordering in the Works Cited list.</li>
<li>For TWO authors: use 'and' between names (second name NOT inverted). The word 'and' is preferred in MLA for its formality and readability.</li>
<li>For THREE OR MORE authors: use 'et al.' after first author only. Do not list additional authors before 'et al.' This simplifies lengthy author lists while maintaining proper attribution. The first author must still use full first name, not initials.</li>
<li>NO AUTHOR: Start with title (ignore 'A', 'An', 'The' for alphabetization). Do not use 'n.d.' or 'Anonymous'. The title becomes the first element and should maintain proper formatting (quotes for short works, italics for complete works).</li>
<li>ALL titles MUST use Title Case (capitalize all major words). This includes articles, books, websites, and all other sources. Title Case means capitalizing the first and last words, and all principal words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercase unless first or last word.</li>
<li>Shorter works use QUOTATION MARKS: Article titles, chapter titles, web page titles, poems, short stories, episodes. These are works that are part of a larger container. Quotation marks indicate the work is not standalone.</li>
<li>Complete works use ITALICS: Book titles, journal names, website names, films, TV series. These are standalone, self-contained works that serve as containers for shorter works. Italics indicate independence and completeness.</li>
<li>Do NOT use both italics AND quotation marks on same title. This is redundant and incorrect. Choose one based on whether the work is shorter (quotes) or complete (italics).</li>
<li>Date placement: AFTER publisher, BEFORE page numbers/URL. The date follows the publisher in the publication sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Special Cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="what-makes-reddit-citations-tricky-in-mla-9">
<h2 >What makes Reddit citations tricky in MLA 9</h2>
<p>Reddit posts and comments look simple, but they create frequent MLA edge cases because the site mixes usernames, deleted accounts, changing titles, edited content, nested threads, and community pages. MLA 9 is flexible, but it still expects you to identify who created the content, what the content is called, where it was published, when it was posted, and how to find it again.</p>
<p>Reddit citations usually fit MLA’s “work on a website” model. A post or comment is a short work, so it is typically placed in quotation marks. The container is the website, Reddit, which is italicized. Then you add date, URL, and an access date if it helps readers retrieve the content.</p>
<p>Your added rules about author names matter a lot here because Reddit often shows only a username. If you can verify a real full name from the user’s profile, an attached bio, or an official linked page, you can use that. If you cannot, treat the username as the author name as it appears, because you cannot responsibly invent a full first name. In other words, use full first names when you truly have them, but do not guess.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="core-mla-format-for-a-reddit-post-or-comment">
<h2 >Core MLA format for a Reddit post or comment</h2>
<h3 id="typical-works-cited-structure-post-or-comment">Typical Works Cited structure (post or comment)</h3>
<p><strong>Author.</strong> “Title of Post or Comment.” <em>Reddit</em>, Day Month Year, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.</p>
<p>Practical note: Reddit often does not provide a clean “title” for a comment. If the comment has no title, you can use a brief descriptive label in quotation marks, such as “Comment on ‘[Post Title]’,” or you can quote the opening words of the comment in place of a title. The goal is clarity and retrievability.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="special-cases-and-edge-cases">
<h2 >Special cases and edge cases</h2>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="1-username-only-no-real-name-available">
<h2 >1) Username only, no real name available</h2>
<p>Many Redditors do not provide a real name. MLA allows you to cite the author as listed. Your rule about full first names supports clarity, but you should not fabricate a “full first name” from a username. If the account name is something like u/BookNerd42, you cite it as BookNerd42.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Drop the “u/” prefix in the author element unless your instructor prefers it. Consistency matters more than one “right” choice. If you keep it, keep it everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Guessing the author’s real identity or expanding a username into a full name. That is inaccurate and undermines credibility.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="2-real-name-available-in-profile-verified-elsewhere">
<h2 >2) Real name available in profile, verified elsewhere</h2>
<p>Sometimes a Reddit user is clearly identifiable, for example an AMA by a public figure, or a user profile that states a full name and links to an official site. If you can confirm a full first name, use it. Follow your inversion rule for the first author in the Works Cited entry.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> MLA’s author element helps readers evaluate authority. Using a verified full name can improve transparency, but only if it is reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Using a name from a rumor in the comments or a third party claim. Only use a full name when it is clearly self identified or otherwise verifiable.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="3-deleted-authors-removed-posts-and-missing-content">
<h2 >3) Deleted authors, removed posts, and missing content</h2>
<p>Reddit content can disappear. You may see labels like “[deleted]” for the author and “[removed]” for the content. MLA does not want you to put “Anonymous” or “n.d.” as a placeholder. If the author is deleted and no author is available, treat it as <strong>no author</strong> and start with the title.</p>
<p>If the post title is also gone, use a short descriptive title in quotation marks, such as “Post in r/AskHistorians (removed).” Then include whatever date and URL remain.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the content is likely to change or disappear, consider saving a screenshot or using a web archive link if your instructor allows it. You can cite the archived URL as the location. Also consider including an access date, since it signals when you saw it.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Leaving the author blank with no title substitute, which makes the entry hard to match to an in text citation.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="4-no-title-especially-for-comments">
<h2 >4) No title, especially for comments</h2>
<p>Comments usually have no formal title. MLA still needs a “title” element, but it can be descriptive. Two practical options:</p>
<p>1) Use a description like: “Comment on ‘[Post Title]’.”<br />
2) Use the first few words of the comment in quotation marks, like: “I tried this method last year…”</p>
<p>Choose the option that best helps a reader locate the comment. If the comment is important and you expect readers to look for it, include the post title in your description.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Treating the subreddit name as the “title.” The subreddit is not the title of the comment or post, it is context.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="5-edited-posts-and-comments">
<h2 >5) Edited posts and comments</h2>
<p>Reddit often shows that a post was edited, sometimes with a timestamp. MLA usually cites the publication date you can verify. If the edit date is important to your argument, you can mention it in your prose, for example, “The post was edited on 14 May 2025.” MLA citations themselves do not require an “edited” label unless it is crucial and you can document it clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you quote something that might change, include an access date and consider quoting from a saved copy.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="6-crossposts-reposts-and-duplicated-content">
<h2 >6) Crossposts, reposts, and duplicated content</h2>
<p>Reddit allows crossposts. Decide what you actually used.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you used the crosspost page you viewed, cite that URL.</li>
<li>If the crosspost clearly points to an original post and you used the original, cite the original.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Readers should be able to follow your trail. Citing the wrong instance can make your evidence impossible to verify.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="7-multiple-authors-in-a-reddit-context">
<h2 >7) Multiple authors in a Reddit context</h2>
<p>Reddit threads can involve many participants, but a single post typically has one author. Edge cases appear when you cite a collaborative post, such as a moderator announcement credited to multiple moderators, or a post that lists multiple authors in the text.</p>
<p>Apply your rules when there truly are multiple authors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two authors:</strong> first author inverted, second in normal order, joined by “and.”</li>
<li><strong>Three or more authors:</strong> first author inverted, then “et al.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common pitfall:</strong> Listing the original poster plus commenters as “authors” of the post. Commenters are separate sources. Cite a specific comment as its own entry if you use it.</p>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="8-subreddit-as-publisher-or-container-and-where-it-fits">
<h2 >8) Subreddit as “publisher” or “container,” and where it fits</h2>
<p>In MLA, Reddit is the container. The subreddit is a section of the site, not a separate publisher. You can include the subreddit name if it helps readers, usually in the title or in a description, but do not replace <em>Reddit</em> with the subreddit name as the container.</p>
<p>Example approach in prose: “In r/PersonalFinance, a user argues that…”<br />

<h2 >9) Long URLs, tracking, and mobile links</h2>
<p>Reddit URLs can be messy, especially on mobile. MLA prefers a stable URL. Use the cleanest version you can, and remove tracking parameters when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Prefer “https://www.reddit.com/…” over “https://www.reddit.com/r/…/s/…” short links when you can, because short links sometimes redirect unpredictably.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Author:</strong> BookNerd42 is the username shown. You are not guessing a real first name.<br />
- <strong>Title in quotes:</strong> A Reddit post is a short work.<br />
- <strong>Container in italics:</strong> <em>Reddit</em> is the website.<br />
- <strong>Date:</strong> Use the date shown on the post.<br />
- <strong>URL:</strong> Gives a direct path to the post.<br />
- <strong>Accessed date:</strong> Helpful because posts can be edited or removed.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls this avoids</strong><br />
- Avoids inventing a full name.<br />
- Avoids italicizing the post title, which would suggest it is a standalone publication.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Author:</strong> Here, the commenter’s real name is used because it is assumed to be available and verifiable. It follows your rule, first author inverted, full first name spelled out.<br />
- <strong>Title:</strong> Comments do not have formal titles, so a descriptive label in quotation marks makes the source identifiable.<br />
- <strong>URL:</strong> Ideally links directly to the comment, not just the top of the thread.</p>
<p><strong>Practical tip</strong><br />
If you cannot verify “Sofia Rivera” as a real name, use the username instead. Do not convert a handle into a full name.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is formatted this way</strong><br />
- <strong>Two authors:</strong> First author inverted, Chen, Amanda Li, second author normal order, and Jordan Matthews, joined by “and,” exactly matching your rule.<br />
- <strong>Title and container:</strong> Still a short work on <em>Reddit</em>.<br />
- <strong>Why author rules matter here:</strong> Moderator posts sometimes list multiple credited authors. Using correct order and “and” makes your Works Cited consistent and easy to alphabetize.</p>
<p><strong>Common pitfalls this avoids</strong><br />
- Avoids inverting the second author, which would break MLA formatting.<br />
- Avoids listing more names than needed if there are three or more. In that case, you would use “et al.” after the first author.</p>

<section class="content-section" id="why-these-rules-matter-in-plain-terms">
<h2 >Why these rules matter (in plain terms)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readers must be able to find the source.</strong> Reddit content moves, gets edited, or disappears. Clean URLs and access dates help.</li>
<li><strong>Your credibility depends on accurate authorship.</strong> Using a verified full name can increase clarity, but guessing names damages trust.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency makes your Works Cited usable.</strong> Inverted first author names support alphabetizing. Clear titles and containers help readers match in text citations to the correct entry.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit is informal, your citation should still be precise.</strong> MLA does not punish you for citing social media, but it expects you to identify what you used.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="content-section" id="quick-practical-tips-and-common-pitfalls-checklist">
<h2 >Quick practical tips and common pitfalls checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>post title in quotation marks</strong>, not italics.</li>
<li>Italicize the <strong>container, <em>Reddit</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Use a <strong>descriptive title for comments</strong>.</li>
<li>Include an <strong>access date</strong> when content might change.</li>
<li>Do not use <strong>“Anonymous”</strong> or <strong>“n.d.”</strong> for missing information.</li>
<li>Do not <strong>invent full first names</strong> from usernames. Use full first names only when you can verify them.</li>
<li>For <strong>two authors</strong>, use <strong>and</strong>, and do not invert the second name.</li>
<li>For <strong>three or more authors</strong>, use <strong>et al.</strong> after the first author only.</li>
<li>Prefer <strong>stable, clean URLs</strong> over mobile redirects or tracking links.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, share a specific Reddit link and tell me whether you are citing the post or a particular comment. I can format the exact MLA 9 Works Cited entry using your author rules.</p>

<h2 >Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-reddit-post-in-mla-9-format">How do I cite a Reddit post in MLA 9 format?</h3>
<p>To cite a Reddit post in MLA 9, treat the post as a work on a website. In your Works Cited entry, start with the author’s username (as it appears), then the post title in quotation marks. After that, list the site name, Reddit, the publisher, Reddit, Inc., the date and time of posting (if available), the URL, and the date you accessed it. Example structure: Username. “Title of Post.” Reddit, Reddit, Inc., Day Month Year, Time, URL. Accessed Day Month Year. In your in text citation, use the username in parentheses, for example (uExampleUser). If you are quoting a specific comment, cite the comment instead of the original post, or clarify in your prose which part you used. For MLA rules and examples, see MLA Works Cited: A Quick Guide, https://style.mla.org/works-cited-a-quick-guide/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-reddit-comment-not-the-original-post">How do I cite a Reddit comment, not the original post?</h3>
<p>To cite a specific Reddit comment, you usually cite the comment as the source you consulted, especially if you quote it or rely on its claims. Use the commenter’s username as the author, then a description or the first words of the comment in quotation marks, since many comments have no title. Next include “Comment on” and the title of the thread in quotation marks, then Reddit, Reddit, Inc., the date and time of the comment, the URL that links directly to the comment, and your access date. Practical scenario: If you quote a comment explaining a video game mechanic, cite the comment, not the post asking the question. In text, cite the username, for example (uCommenter). If you cannot link directly to the comment, link to the thread and identify the comment by date and username in your prose. More guidance on citing web content is at https://style.mla.org/citing-websites/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-if-the-reddit-username-is-weird-deleted-or-anonymous-can-i-still-cite-it">What if the Reddit username is weird, deleted, or anonymous, can I still cite it?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can still cite Reddit even if the username is unusual or missing. If the username is present, reproduce it exactly as shown, including capitalization and punctuation. If the author is listed as “deleted” or the account no longer exists, you can use “deleted” as the author element, since that is what the page displays. If there is no author shown at all, start the Works Cited entry with the post title or a brief description in quotation marks. Practical scenario: You saved a permalink to a comment and later the user was deleted, your citation can still point readers to the archived discussion. Always include the URL and an access date, since Reddit content can change. If you are concerned about stability, consider also using a web archive link when permitted by your instructor. For MLA guidance on missing authors, see https://style.mla.org/citing-works-with-unknown-authors/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-have-to-include-the-subreddit-the-post-time-and-the-access-date-when-citing-reddit">Do I have to include the subreddit, the post time, and the access date when citing Reddit?</h3>
<p>Include details that help readers locate the exact item. The subreddit name can be helpful, but it is not required if the URL clearly identifies the thread. The post time is optional in MLA, but it is useful for Reddit because threads can be edited and comments can be numerous. If the page lists a full timestamp, you may include it after the date. The access date is strongly recommended for Reddit because content can be edited, removed, or reordered. Practical scenario: You cite a comment in a fast moving news thread, including the timestamp and access date helps a reader confirm which statement you used. If your instructor prefers minimal entries, keep the core elements, author, title or description, Reddit, date, URL, accessed date. For MLA’s general web citation guidance, consult https://style.mla.org/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-cite-a-reddit-post-that-has-no-clear-title-like-an-image-post-or-a-short-question">How do I cite a Reddit post that has no clear title, like an image post or a short question?</h3>
<p>If a Reddit post has a short or unclear title, you still cite what appears as the post title on the page, even if it is brief. If there is truly no title, create a concise description in plain language and place it in quotation marks, for example “Photo of campus flooding near the library.” Then list Reddit as the website, the date, the URL, and your access date. Practical scenario: You use a Reddit image post as an example of public reaction to an event, your description should identify the content and context so a reader understands what you cited. If the image is hosted on a separate site (like i.redd.it or Imgur), cite the version you actually used, and consider citing both if you analyzed the Reddit discussion and the image itself. For help creating titles and citing untitled works, see https://style.mla.org/titles/.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-in-text-citations-for-reddit-and-what-if-i-mention-the-username-in-my-sentence">How do I do in text citations for Reddit, and what if I mention the username in my sentence?</h3>
<p>In MLA 9, in text citations should point to the first element of your Works Cited entry. For Reddit, that is usually the username, so a parenthetical citation often looks like (uExampleUser). If you mention the username in your sentence, you can omit it from the parentheses, and include only what is needed, often nothing else, since Reddit posts do not have page numbers. Practical scenario: You write, “According to uExampleUser, the policy changed in 2023,” then you may not need a parenthetical citation at the end of that sentence if it is clear which source you mean and it matches your Works Cited entry. If you cite multiple posts by the same user, add a shortened title in the parentheses to distinguish them. For MLA in text citation basics, see https://style.mla.org/in-text-citations/.</p>
