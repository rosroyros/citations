<p><strong>IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing papers from the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) requires adherence to specific formatting guidelines aligned with IEEE standards. Unlike general source citations, conference papers typically include the names of all authors, followed by the title of the paper in quotation marks, the name of the conference in italics, the location, and the year of the conference. For example, a citation might look like this: J. Doe and A. Smith, "Title of the Paper," <em>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)</em>, Seoul, Korea, 2019, pp. 123-128. This format emphasizes the conference's name and location, providing details that are critical for identifying the specific event where the research was presented.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion for students is distinguishing between the conference proceedings and journal articles. Conference papers typically have a more detailed citation, as they include both the location and the exact pages from the proceedings. Additionally, students often overlook the use of italics for the conference name and may forget to include all necessary elements such as page numbers or the conference's location. It is crucial to verify these details to maintain accuracy.</p>
<p>To avoid these common pitfalls, students should always refer to the official IEEE citation guidelines and double-check each component of the citation. It is also advisable to use citation management tools that support IEEE format to ensure consistency. Paying close attention to the details of the conference name, location, and year will help students produce precise and reliable citations for their academic work.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-ieeecvf-international-conference-on-computer-vision">Common Issues When Citing IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify the authors of papers presented at the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). This can lead to incorrect citations and potential breaches of academic integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Conference proceedings, unlike journal articles, often involve multiple contributors, including editors, conference organizers, and paper authors. The complex structure of these documents can make it difficult to discern the actual authors of a specific paper.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the official IEEE Xplore Digital Library.<br />
2. Navigate to the specific ICCV conference year and locate the desired paper.<br />
3. Look for the section labeled "Authors" at the beginning of the paper or in the document's metadata.<br />
4. Ensure that the list of names corresponds to the paper's contributors, not the editors or conference organizers.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: "IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision organizing committee."</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: "Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Zhang, L."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Another common issue is the improper formatting of publication dates in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Conference proceedings often span multiple days, and students may be unsure whether to list the entire conference date range or the specific presentation date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the official publication year as listed in the conference proceedings.<br />
2. Typically, this is the year in which the proceedings were published, often found on the first page or cover of the proceedings document.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: "October 27-28, 2021."</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: "2021."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently make errors when including URLs in their citations, either by omitting them or using incorrect formats.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
URL inclusion can be confusing due to variations in access and citation requirements, especially for students who may be unfamiliar with digital object identifiers (DOIs).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always use the DOI provided by IEEE for the paper, as it is a permanent link.<br />
2. If the DOI is unavailable, use the stable URL from the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.<br />
3. Format the URL or DOI according to citation guidelines, ensuring it is accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: "http://example.com/paper123"</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2021.12345"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may encounter issues accessing full papers, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Access to the IEEE Xplore Digital Library often requires institutional or personal subscriptions, which can create barriers for students.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Verify access through your academic institution’s library portal, which may provide free access.<br />
2. Utilize interlibrary loan services if direct access is not available.<br />
3. Cite using available information, and note the lack of access if full details cannot be obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: Citing without access, leading to incomplete bibliographic details.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: Include a note such as "[Accessed via university library subscription]" if access is noted in citation.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Citing papers from the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision presents unique challenges due to the structure of conference proceedings and digital access considerations. By understanding these common issues and employing strategies for accurate citation, students can ensure they meet academic standards and maintain integrity in their scholarly work.</p>
