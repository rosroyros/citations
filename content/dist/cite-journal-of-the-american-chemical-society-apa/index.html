<p><strong>Journal of the American Chemical Society-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), students should be aware of specific formatting requirements that differ from general APA guidelines. In JACS, the list of authors is presented with the last name followed by initials without periods. Unlike the standard APA rule that allows listing up to 20 authors, JACS typically lists all authors, regardless of the number, which can sometimes exceed 20. This is a notable deviation from standard APA formatting and is important to adhere to when preparing citations for JACS articles.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises around the order and format of author names and the use of commas and semicolons. In JACS, authors are usually separated by semicolons, and the last author is preceded by "and," which is different from the APA's use of commas and an ampersand (&amp;). Moreover, the journal title is italicized, and the publication year is placed immediately after the authors' names in parentheses, emphasizing a specific sequence that students must follow.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should carefully check the specific citation format required by JACS and compare it against APA rules. Best practices include consulting the JACS author guidelines directly and using citation tools tailored to chemical literature. Additionally, students should pay attention to details such as italicization and the precise order of citation elements, ensuring that every aspect of the citation conforms to JACS's unique style. This attention to detail will help avoid errors and ensure proper attribution of sources in this specialized journal.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

Ensure you capture the full title as it appears, including any subtitles or additional information presented there.</p>
<h3 id="urlaccess-information">URL/Access Information</h3>
<p>The URL can be found in the browser's address bar at the top of your web browser when you are viewing the article. This URL should be copied directly as it appears to ensure accurate access information. The JACS website URLs are stable, meaning they should not change over time, making them reliable for citation purposes.</p>
<h3 id="additional-tips">Additional Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DOI</strong>: In addition to the URL, JACS provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for each article, which is an excellent resource for citation. The DOI is usually located near the top of the article page or in the citation tools section. It provides a permanent link to the article.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding where to look for each piece of information, you can efficiently gather the necessary details for your citations from JACS. Always double-check each element for accuracy, as precise citation is key to maintaining academic integrity.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-journal-of-the-american-chemical-society">Common Issues When Citing Journal of the American Chemical Society</h2>
<p><strong>1. Identifying Authors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
A common problem students face when citing articles from the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) is accurately identifying all authors involved, particularly in articles with many contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JACS, like many scientific journals, often publishes articles with multiple authors due to the collaborative nature of scientific research. This can lead to confusion, especially when articles have more than 20 authors, requiring students to know how to correctly list them according to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
To correctly list authors from a JACS article:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, navigate to the article's webpage on the JACS site or access the PDF version where authorship is typically listed at the beginning.</li>
<li>In APA format, list up to 20 authors. For articles with more than 20 authors, list the first 19, followed by an ellipsis (…), and then the final author's name.</li>
<li>Ensure the order of authors is maintained as per the source.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before:<br />
Smith, J., &amp; Doe, A. (2023). … [an incomplete list]</p>
<p>After:<br />
Smith, J., Doe, A., Johnson, B., …, &amp; Lastname, Z. (2023). … [complete list with ellipsis]</p>
<p><strong>2. Date Formats</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with the correct formatting of publication dates, especially when only the year is available or when dealing with early access articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JACS articles may sometimes provide only the year of publication, or students might access articles before final publication, which can cause uncertainty about how to cite the date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- For published articles, use the full year provided. If only the year is available, format the date as (Year).<br />
- For early access articles, use the year of early access and note the status as 'Advance online publication' if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before:<br />
(2023, March 5)</p>
<p>After:<br />
(2023) or (2023). Advance online publication.</p>
<p><strong>3. URL Handling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often mishandle URLs, either by omitting them or using incorrect formats when citing JACS articles accessed online.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JACS articles may be accessed through multiple platforms, and students may be unsure which URL to use, especially if accessing through a library database.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- Always use the DOI if available. If not, provide a stable URL. Avoid using library database URLs, which are session-specific.<br />
- Format the URL as a hyperlink in the reference list, ensuring it is clickable.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before:<br />
Retrieved from http://library.acme.edu/jacs/2023-article</p>
<p>After:<br />
https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.XXXXXX</p>
<p><strong>4. Access Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes fail to note access restrictions, which can affect the completeness of the citation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JACS is a subscription-based journal, meaning that not all students may have direct access to articles, especially when citing from non-university networks.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- If accessing through a university library, ensure you are logged in to see all citation details.<br />
- For articles behind paywalls, include the DOI or stable URL to indicate the source's authenticity, even if the full text is not publicly accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before:<br />
Journal of the American Chemical Society, 145(5), 2345-2350.</p>
<p>After:<br />
Journal of the American Chemical Society, 145(5), 2345-2350. https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.XXXXXX</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges, students can accurately cite JACS articles in compliance with APA 7th edition guidelines, ensuring clarity and consistency in their academic work.</p>
