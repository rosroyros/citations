<p><strong>Journal of Cleaner Production-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the Journal of Cleaner Production, it is important to follow the specific formatting requirements that align with APA 7th edition guidelines while also giving attention to any journal-specific nuances. The Journal of Cleaner Production, like many other journals, expects citations to reflect the APA style, which includes listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis. This means when citing an article with multiple authors, you must list all authors’ last names followed by their initials up to and including the 20th author. For instance, an article with 20 authors would list each one in order, separated by commas, followed by the publication year in parentheses.</p>
<p>One area where students often get confused is in the application of the ellipsis after the 20th author when more than 20 authors are involved. Unlike older APA editions, where only up to seven authors were listed before an ellipsis, APA 7th now allows up to 20. This can lead to errors if students are not aware of this update. Additionally, some students may mistakenly apply special formatting rules specific to the journal that do not exist, such as unnecessary abbreviations or incorrect ordering of elements.</p>
<p>To avoid these common pitfalls, students should carefully adhere to APA 7th edition guidelines while being aware that the Journal of Cleaner Production does not impose additional unique citation requirements beyond APA standards. It is advisable to use a citation management tool and cross-reference with the APA manual to ensure accuracy. Keeping up-to-date with APA changes and consistently applying these rules will help maintain proper citation practices for articles from the Journal of Cleaner Production.</p>
