<h2 id="quick-reference-cell-citations">Quick Reference: Cell Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Cell-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from Cell, a prominent scientific journal, requires attention to specific formatting details that differ from standard APA citation guidelines. Unlike typical APA citations, which list only up to 20 authors with their last names and initials, Cell mandates listing up to 30 authors before using "et al." This is an important distinction because it ensures that more contributors receive credit for their work, reflecting the collaborative nature of scientific research. Additionally, while APA style typically requires the use of a hanging indent for reference lists, Cell citations must adhere to the journal's own formatting preferences, often requiring a more compact layout which might not include indents.</p>
<p>One common point of confusion for students is the structuring of the reference entry. For instance, in APA, the title of the journal article is in sentence case, whereas in Cell, it might follow different capitalization rules. Students should carefully check the journal's specific guidelines or published articles as examples. Furthermore, the Cell format may also influence how digital object identifiers (DOIs) are presented or how journal volume and issue numbers are arranged, which can deviate from standard APA presentation.</p>
<p>To avoid mistakes, students should thoroughly review Cell's author guidelines or consult recent articles from the journal to understand its citation style. It's also beneficial to use citation management tools that offer customizable templates for different journal requirements, ensuring accuracy and consistency. When in doubt, consulting a librarian or academic advisor familiar with scientific publications can provide additional clarity.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-cell">Where to Find Citation Information on Cell</h2>
<p>Navigating the Cell website (https://www.cell.com/cell) to find citation information is a straightforward process, once you understand its layout. This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to locate essential citation components: author, publication date, title, and URL/access info.</p>
<p><strong>1. Locating the Author(s):</strong><br />
When you open an article on the Cell website, the author byline is prominently displayed near the top of the article page. Look directly beneath the article title, where you will find the names of the authors listed. If there are multiple authors, they will be separated by commas. This placement allows for easy identification of the contributors to the research.</p>
<p><strong>2. Finding the Publication Date:</strong><br />
The publication date on Cell articles is located directly under the author byline. It is typically formatted as "Published: Month Day, Year" and is easily visible, ensuring that you can quickly determine when the article was published. This is particularly useful for understanding the currency of the research.</p>
<p><strong>3. Identifying the Title of the Article:</strong><br />
The title of the article is prominently displayed at the very top of the page, in a larger and bold font. This makes it the first piece of information you encounter, ensuring that you can easily determine the subject of the article. The title is crucial for your citation as it precisely defines the content and focus of the research.</p>
<p><strong>4. Accessing the URL:</strong><br />
The URL for the article is found in the browser's address bar at the top of your web browser. This URL is unique to the article you are viewing, providing direct access to the online content. Copy the full URL to ensure accurate citation, which is essential for referencing and revisiting the article later.</p>
<p><strong>5. Additional Citation Information:</strong><br />
For further citation details, such as DOI (Digital Object Identifier), scroll to the bottom of the article page. Cell often provides a DOI, which is a permanent identifier that enhances the reliability and accessibility of the source. Including the DOI in your citation is recommended if available.</p>
<p><strong>Unique Features of Cell:</strong><br />
One distinctive feature of Cell's website is its clear and organized presentation of citation information, which is designed to facilitate efficient academic referencing. Moreover, Cell often provides supplementary material and related content links, which can offer additional insights and data for comprehensive research.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you can effectively gather all necessary citation information from the Cell website, ensuring that your academic work is properly referenced in accordance with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-cell">Common Issues When Citing Cell</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify all the authors of articles published in Cell, especially when there are numerous contributors or when the authors are listed in a non-standard order.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Cell often features collaborative research articles with large author lists, sometimes including group authorship or consortiums. This can be confusing, particularly if students are unfamiliar with distinguishing between individual and group authors in academic papers.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the full article on Cell's website.<br />
2. Locate the ‘Authors’ section, typically just below the title or abstract.<br />
3. List all authors in the order they are presented. If there is a group author, list it as presented, without individual names, unless specified.<br />
4. If the author list is extensive, use the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author, as per APA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., &amp; Jones, L. (only two authors listed for a paper with many more)<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Jones, L., Taylor, M., Brown, R., Green, A., White, T., … Young, P. (correctly listing authors as per APA)</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-format">Problem 2: Date Format</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often misrepresent the publication date, which is crucial for correctly citing academic articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Cell employs a continuous online publication model, meaning articles may be published online before appearing in a print issue, leading to confusion about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the online publication date if the article is available only online or if it appears before the print edition.<br />
2. Locate the 'Published Online' date at the top or bottom of the article.<br />
3. Format the date as Year, Month Day (e.g., 2023, March 14) in APA style.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> March 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> 2023, March 14</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with formatting and including URLs in their citations, particularly when dealing with DOIs vs. URLs for Cell articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Cell articles are often accessed via DOIs rather than direct URLs, which can cause confusion about which to include in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always prefer the DOI over a URL when available. It is a more stable and permanent link.<br />
2. Locate the DOI, typically found in the article's header or footer.<br />
3. Format the DOI as a URL: <code>https://doi.org/</code> followed by the DOI number.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.cell.com/article/S0092867419304897<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.03.014</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not realize that access to some articles requires institutional or personal subscriptions, affecting their ability to retrieve and correctly cite these sources.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
While some Cell articles are open access, many are behind a paywall, necessitating subscription access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Verify access through your institution’s library portal.<br />
2. For open access articles, clearly note any Creative Commons licenses that may apply.<br />
3. If citing an article behind a paywall, do not include "Retrieved from" unless the article is openly accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.cell.com/article/S0092867419304897<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Only include DOI without retrieval URL if behind a paywall.</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges specific to Cell, students can ensure accurate and APA-compliant references, enhancing the quality and credibility of their academic work.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-cell">Frequently Asked Questions About Cell</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How can I navigate Cell's website to find the necessary citation information?</strong></p>
<p>A: To find citation information on Cell's website, go to the article's page and look for the "Cite" or "Citation" tool, often located near the article title or abstract. This tool typically provides citation details, including authors, publication date, article title, journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I handle the unique author formats used by Cell in my APA citation?</strong></p>
<p>A: Cell sometimes lists authors with initials and without full first names. In APA format, convert these to the standard "Last name, Initial(s)" format. For example, if an author is listed as "J. Doe," cite as "Doe, J." If there are multiple authors, list up to 20 before using an ellipsis.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I deal with Cell's publication date formats in APA citations?</strong></p>
<p>A: Cell often provides specific publication dates, including day, month, and year. In APA format, include as much specific information as possible: "Year, Month Day." For instance, if an article was published on March 5, 2023, format the date as "2023, March 5."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the URL and access requirements when citing an article from Cell?</strong></p>
<p>A: When citing an online article from Cell, include the direct URL to the article's page. APA 7th edition recommends using a DOI instead of a URL if available. If a DOI is provided, format it as "https://doi.org/xxxx" and include it at the end of your reference.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing an article from Cell differ from other journal article sources in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: While the basic APA format for journal articles applies, Cell may have unique features like multiple authors or specific publication details. Ensure you include all available data accurately and format the citation based on APA guidelines, focusing on authorship, publication date, title, journal name, volume, issue, page range, and DOI/URL.</p>
