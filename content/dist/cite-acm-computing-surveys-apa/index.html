<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>ACM Computing Surveys-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from ACM Computing Surveys requires attention to detail, particularly because this journal, published by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), may follow specific conventions that differ slightly from standard APA citation practices. One unique aspect is the consistent use of digital object identifiers (DOIs) in ACM publications, which should always be included in citations. The format typically requires the author's last name, followed by their initials, and should be listed in the order they appear in the publication. In ACM Computing Surveys, if there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis and the final author's name, without using an ampersand.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises from the fact that ACM publications often include a variety of document identifiers and publication dates. Students should ensure they are using the most specific publication date available and include the DOI, as this is a crucial component in ACM citations. Another potential pitfall is the formatting of titles. In ACM Computing Surveys, article titles should be in sentence case, capitalizing only the first word and proper nouns.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should carefully check each element of the citation against the publication's information. It's essential to ensure the correct order and format of authors' names, the accurate use of DOI, and the proper presentation of the publication title and date. Utilizing citation management tools that support ACM formats can also help streamline the process and reduce errors. Additionally, reviewing the official ACM Digital Library resources can provide further clarification and examples specific to ACM Computing Surveys.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-acm-computing-surveys">Common Issues When Citing ACM Computing Surveys</h2>
<h2 id="common-citation-problems-when-citing-acm-computing-surveys">Common Citation Problems When Citing ACM Computing Surveys</h2>
<p>Citing articles from ACM Computing Surveys can present unique challenges due to its specific format and interface. Here, we’ll address common issues such as finding authors, formatting dates, handling URLs, and understanding access requirements, providing practical solutions for each problem.</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-finding-authors">Problem 1: Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to find the correct author names when citing articles from ACM Computing Surveys. This confusion arises because the interface lists multiple contributors, including editors and reviewers, alongside the primary authors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACM Computing Surveys often features collaborative articles with numerous contributors, and the website interface sometimes presents these names in a non-intuitive order, making it tricky for students to identify the primary authors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Navigate to the article’s main page on the ACM Digital Library.<br />
2. Look for the section labeled "Authors" at the top of the article information.<br />
3. Identify the primary authors listed, usually those involved in the content creation rather than editing or reviewing.<br />
4. Use the "Cite" tool on the page to verify the author list if available, but cross-reference with the main text to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> R. Smith, J. Doe, Editors (incorrect)</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> J. Doe, R. Smith (correct)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently encounter issues with formatting publication dates correctly, especially when the ACM interface displays dates in various formats.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACM Computing Surveys may show several dates, such as submission, acceptance, and publication, leading to confusion about which date to use in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the "Publication Date" listed on the article page, as this reflects when the article was officially published.<br />
2. Convert the date to the APA format: Year, Month Day.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> 12/14/2022</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> December 14, 2022</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Handling URLs can be problematic, especially when ACM Computing Surveys articles have complex or lengthy URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The URLs provided by the ACM Digital Library include session identifiers and other parameters that are unnecessary for citation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. From the article page, use the "Permalink" feature to obtain a stable URL.<br />
2. Include only this permalink in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=XXXXXXX&amp;CFID=XXXX&amp;CFTOKEN=XXXX</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/XXXXXXX</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students might have difficulty understanding access requirements and mistakenly cite articles they cannot directly access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACM Computing Surveys often restricts full article access to subscribers or institutional members, which can confuse students about how to cite these sources correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if your institution provides access. Use institutional login if available.<br />
2. If access is restricted, indicate this in the citation by adding "Retrieved from" followed by the URL.<br />
3. Always ensure you have accessed the full text or a reliable abstract before citing.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=XXXXXXX</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> Retrieved from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/XXXXXXX</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while citing ACM Computing Surveys can be challenging due to author identification, date formatting, URL management, and access requirements, understanding and applying these solutions can simplify the process. By following these steps, students can ensure their citations are accurate and compliant with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
