<p><strong>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing papers from the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) requires attention to specific details that differ from general source type citations. In IEEE format, which is commonly used for CVPR papers, the citation includes the author(s) name(s), title of the paper, name of the conference, location, date, and page numbers. For example, a complete citation might look like this: [1] A. B. Author, "Title of paper," in <em>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</em>, City, State, Country, Month Year, pp. xxx-xxx. Note that the conference name should be italicized, and the page numbers should be specified, which is a unique feature of IEEE citations compared to other formats like APA.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion for students is differentiating the conference proceedings from journal publications. Unlike journals, conference proceedings require the inclusion of both the location and date of the conference, which are critical components often overlooked. Additionally, students sometimes mistakenly italicize the entire citation, whereas only the conference name should be italicized. Furthermore, students might forget to include all the essential details such as the page range, which is crucial for IEEE citations.</p>
<p>To avoid these common mistakes, students should always refer to the official IEEE style manual and use citation management tools that support IEEE format. It is also beneficial to check the conference’s official website or the paper itself for accurate details on the conference location and dates. Ensuring these elements are correctly formatted will help maintain the integrity and professionalism expected in CVPR paper citations.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-ieeecvf-conference-on-computer-vision-and-pattern-recognition">Common Issues When Citing IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
One common problem students face when citing papers from the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) is identifying the correct authors. This challenge arises because conference papers often have multiple authors, and their names may not be prominently displayed, particularly in online databases or conference websites.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This problem occurs because conference proceedings typically have a high volume of papers, and the digital platforms hosting them may prioritize other metadata over author names. Additionally, some platforms may list authors inconsistently or in a condensed format, making it difficult to discern who contributed to the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Full Paper:</strong> Begin by downloading the full PDF of the paper from the official conference website or a recognized database like IEEE Xplore. This will provide a clear list of authors on the first page.<br />
2. <strong>Check Multiple Sources:</strong> If the authors are not easily identifiable, check additional resources such as Google Scholar or the authors' institutional pages.<br />
3. <strong>Verify Author Order:</strong> Ensure you have the correct order of authors, as this can be crucial in academic citations.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Smith et al.</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> John Smith, Emily Chen, and Michael Brown</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Another issue is using the correct date format when citing conference papers. Students may be uncertain about which part of the date is relevant or may use inconsistent formats.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The confusion stems from the fact that conference papers might mention multiple dates, such as the conference date, publication date, and online availability date. Students might not know which to prioritize.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the Conference Date:</strong> The date to use is the year of the conference, as this is standard for citing conference proceedings.<br />
2. <strong>Check the Conference Proceedings:</strong> Look for the official conference proceedings or the IEEE Xplore entry to confirm the correct year.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> CVPR, 2022-06-19</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> CVPR, 2022</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with properly including and formatting URLs for conference papers, especially when URLs are long or complex.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
URLs for conference papers can be lengthy and cumbersome, and students may be unsure if the URL should be included, especially if accessing the paper requires specific institutional credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use Permanent Links:</strong> Always use a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available, as it provides a permanent link to the document.<br />
2. <strong>Shorten URLs:</strong> If a DOI is not available, consider using URL shortening services to create a manageable link.<br />
3. <strong>Include Access Information:</strong> If the paper is behind a paywall, indicate that it was accessed through a specific institutional login.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Smith_Paper_Title_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR2022.123456</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Accessing CVPR papers often requires navigating through institutional accesses or paywalls, making it difficult for students to retrieve full texts for citation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This issue arises because many conference papers are hosted on platforms that require subscriptions or institutional access, such as IEEE Xplore or the CVF Open Access system.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use Institutional Access:</strong> Log in through your university's library portal to gain access to the papers.<br />
2. <strong>Check for Open Access:</strong> Some papers are available for free on the CVF Open Access Archive, so check there before using paywalled sources.<br />
3. <strong>Contact Authors:</strong> As a last resort, consider contacting the authors directly for a copy if it’s not accessible through other means.</p>
<p>By addressing these common challenges with specific solutions, students can more effectively cite papers from the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, ensuring accuracy and compliance with citation standards.</p>
