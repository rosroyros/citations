<p><strong>International Journal of Production Economics-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the International Journal of Production Economics in APA 7th edition, there are no unique formatting requirements specific to this journal that differ from the general APA guidelines for journal articles. However, it's crucial to follow the standard APA format for journal citations, which includes listing up to 20 authors. This is a key detail, as APA 7th edition allows for the inclusion of all authors' names if there are 20 or fewer, which is a shift from the previous edition that required an ellipsis after the 6th author when a work had more than seven authors.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises when dealing with articles that have multiple authors. Students often mistakenly truncate the author list prematurely, not realizing that all authors should be listed if the total is 20 or fewer. For the International Journal of Production Economics, this means paying careful attention to the author list and ensuring each author is credited in the citation. The format follows the pattern: Author, A. A., Author, B. B., &amp; Author, C. C. (Year). Title of the article. <em>Journal Name</em>, <em>Volume</em>(Issue), page range. https://doi.org/xxx</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should double-check the total number of authors and consult the journal's website or their library's database to ensure they have the correct and complete list of authors. Additionally, it is essential to include the digital object identifier (DOI) in the citation, as it provides a permanent link to the article. By adhering to these practices, students can accurately cite articles from the International Journal of Production Economics and avoid common pitfalls related to author listing and DOI inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h3 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Article Information</strong> <br />
   - <strong>Action:</strong> Locate the article you want to cite. This will typically be found on the journal's website or a database where the journal is published.<br />
   - <strong>Verification:</strong> Ensure you have the following details: the authors' names, publication year, article title, journal title, volume number, issue number, page range, and a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available. <br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate:</strong> 5-10 minutes<br />

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Format the Authors’ Names</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action:</strong> Write the authors' last names followed by their initials. If there are multiple authors, separate them with commas and use an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name. <br />
   - <strong>Verification:</strong> Double-check the spelling of the authors' names to ensure accuracy.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate:</strong> 2-5 minutes<br />
   - <strong>Tip:</strong> For articles with more than 20 authors, refer to the APA manual for guidance on how to format them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Include the Publication Year</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action:</strong> After the authors' names, insert the year of publication in parentheses. Follow this with a period. <br />
   - <strong>Verification:</strong> Confirm that you have the correct year by checking the article's publication date.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate:</strong> 1 minute<br />
   - <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure the year is not confused with the date of online publication, if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write the Title of the Article</strong><br />

   - <strong>Time Estimate:</strong> 3-5 minutes<br />
   - <strong>Tip:</strong> If the title is long, focus on clarity and conciseness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Include the Journal Title, Volume, and Issue</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action:</strong> Write the journal title in italics, following it with the volume number in italics. If there is an issue number, place it in parentheses directly after the volume number (not italicized). End this portion with a comma.<br />

   - <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to include all pages that the article covers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insert the DOI</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action:</strong> Finally, if a DOI is available, include it at the end of the citation. Format it as "https://doi.org/xxxxx" where "xxxxx" is the DOI number.<br />
   - <strong>Verification:</strong> Double-check that the DOI is correct and active by clicking on it.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate:</strong> 2-5 minutes<br />
   - <strong>Tip:</strong> If a DOI is not available, you may use the URL of the article instead, but ensure it leads directly to the article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review Your Citation</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action:</strong> Look over your entire citation to ensure all elements are in the correct order and properly formatted according to APA guidelines. <br />
   - <strong>Verification:</strong> Compare your citation against an APA style guide or use an online citation generator for reference.<br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-international-journal-of-production-economics">Common Issues When Citing International Journal of Production Economics</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly identifying the authors of articles from the International Journal of Production Economics (IJPE). This can lead to incorrect citations if authors are omitted or misattributed.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJPE, like many academic journals, lists multiple authors for a single article. This can be challenging if the authors are not clearly delineated or if their roles (e.g., corresponding author) are not adequately highlighted on the journal's interface.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Navigate to the article's page on the IJPE website.<br />
2. Look for the "Authors" section, usually positioned at the top of the article page or near the abstract.<br />
3. Carefully list all authors in the order presented, as APA 7th edition requires maintaining the original order.<br />
4. If the authors' names are abbreviated, find the full names often available in the article's PDF or by checking the authors' institutional affiliations.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> J. Smith, A. Brown<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., &amp; Brown, A.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-formatting-date-of-publication">Problem 2: Formatting Date of Publication</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Incorrect date formatting is a common issue, particularly for journals that publish articles online ahead of print.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJPE articles may have different "available online" dates and actual "published" dates. Students often confuse these two, leading to incorrect date citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check the article's page for the specific "published online" date, usually near the title or abstract.<br />
2. Use the online publication date if the article has not yet been assigned to a specific issue.<br />
3. Format the date in accordance with APA guidelines: (Year, Month Day).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023, July 15)</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently mishandle URLs, either by omitting them or including incomplete links in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJPE often uses DOI (Digital Object Identifier) links, which may be overlooked by students unfamiliar with how to properly format these in APA style.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the DOI on the article’s page, usually listed under the title or abstract.<br />
2. Use the DOI link in the format: "https://doi.org/xxxx" as APA 7th edition prefers DOIs over URLs.<br />
3. If a DOI is unavailable, use the direct URL of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> www.elsevier.com/ijpe-article<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2023.105782</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students can struggle with properly citing articles if they have access restrictions, such as subscription requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJPE articles may require institutional access, leading students to bypass proper access links or cite incomplete information.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Ensure access through university or institutional library portals.<br />
2. If access is unavailable, seek alternative routes like contacting authors or using interlibrary loans.<br />
3. Always cite the DOI or stable URL, regardless of access issues, as this maintains consistency and allows others to locate the article.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Article accessed through university library.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2023.105782"</p>
<p>By understanding these specific challenges and following the provided solutions, students can accurately cite articles from the International Journal of Production Economics in APA 7th edition format, ensuring compliance and scholarly integrity.</p>
