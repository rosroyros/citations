<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology" follows the general APA 7th edition guidelines but with considerations for the journal's specific attributes. One unique aspect is the potential number of authors that may need to be included. In APA style, when citing a work with up to 20 authors, all author names should be listed in the reference. This is particularly relevant to articles from "Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology" which often involve multiple contributors. Begin with the last name followed by initials for each author, separated by commas, and use an ampersand before the final author's name. For example: Smith, J., Doe, A., &amp; Brown, C.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises in distinguishing between the journal's name and the article title, which should be italicized. Students often mistakenly italicize both or fail to apply italics at all. Remember, only the journal title is italicized in the reference list. Additionally, ensure proper capitalization: capitalize only the first word of the article title and subtitle, if any, as well as any proper nouns. </p>
<p>Best practices for citing "Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology" include double-checking for DOI availability, as this ensures the most accurate and direct access to the source. When present, format the DOI as a hyperlink beginning with "https://doi.org/". This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of your citations. Lastly, given the frequency of multi-author articles in this journal, utilize reference management tools to streamline the citation process and minimize manual errors.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Author Information:</strong><br />
   - When you open an article on ScienceDirect, the author's name(s) are prominently displayed near the top of the page, just below the title of the article. Typically, the author byline is immediately beneath the article title and will list the contributing authors. Look for hyperlinked names, which often provide more detailed information about the authors if clicked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong><br />
   - The publication date is usually found just below the author's name(s), often in the format of month and year. On ScienceDirect, it is standard to see this information prominently displayed, making it relatively easy to locate right after the author details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Article Title:</strong><br />
   - The title of the article is one of the most visible elements and is usually located at the top of the article page. It is typically formatted in a larger and bold font to differentiate it from other text on the page. Ensure you note the full title as it appears, including any subtitles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL/Access Information:</strong><br />
   - To find the URL for citation purposes, simply look to the browser's address bar at the top of your web browser. The full URL can be copied directly from here. For stable URLs, especially in academic settings, ensure you are logged into your institution's library portal if necessary, to access the correct link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Tips:</strong><br />
   - If you are accessing the journal through an institutional library, ensure you are logged into your library account to gain full access to subscription-based content.<br />
   - For some articles, there might be additional sections such as 'Abstract' or 'Keywords' following the title and author information, which can help in understanding the context of the article but are not usually part of the citation information.<br />
   - Look for the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) often provided near the article’s title or abstract. It is a unique identifier for the electronic document and is crucial for APA citations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you should be able to efficiently gather all necessary citation information for articles from "Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology." This method ensures accuracy and adherence to academic standards when referencing scholarly articles.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-trends-in-food-science-technology">Common Issues When Citing Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Finding Authors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and cite the authors of articles from the journal Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology. This issue is compounded by the journal's presentation format, where multiple authors are frequently involved, and their names may not be immediately visible in the digital or print interface. </p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal's typical layout includes a detailed list of authors, sometimes exceeding five or more, and this list can be obscured by other publication details or displayed in a compact format that requires expansion to view fully. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect author citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the article through the journal's website or a database that hosts the journal.<br />
2. Look for a section labeled 'Authors' or check the abstract page where author names are usually listed.<br />
3. If the list is truncated, look for an option to view more details or expand the information.<br />
4. Record all authors in the order they appear for your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J. &amp; Smith, A. (2022). Title of the article.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., Brown, B., &amp; Wilson, C. (2022). Title of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Date Formats</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students encounter challenges with correctly formatting the publication date, particularly when articles are published online ahead of print, which is common in scientific journals like Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This journal often provides an "online first" publication date which differs from the print publication date. Students may incorrectly use the print date or fail to recognize the distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the publication date on the article's webpage; it is usually located near the article title or abstract.<br />
2. Use the earliest available date labeled as the 'published online' date.<br />
3. Format the date in APA style: year only if the full date is not available, or year, month, and day for online-first articles.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J. (n.d.).  </p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J. (2022, March 15).</p>
<p><strong>URL Handling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often mishandle URLs when citing articles, especially when accessing Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology through university portals or databases, leading to inaccessible or non-permanent links.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
URLs from institutional access points may include session-specific data or may redirect through proxy servers, creating unstable URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the article directly from the journal's website or a stable permalink provided by the database.<br />
2. Look for a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and use it instead of a URL when available, as DOIs provide a permanent link to the content.<br />
3. If using a URL, ensure it is a stable link by checking if it works in a private browsing session.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
https://universitylibrary.proxy.edu/article123</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2022.03.015</p>
<p><strong>Access Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not properly indicate access restrictions or confuse open-access articles with those behind paywalls when citing.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology includes a mix of open-access and subscription-based articles, which can cause confusion about how to indicate accessibility in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Determine the access type by checking for open-access labels or access notes on the article's webpage.<br />
2. If the article is open access, no special note is needed in the citation.<br />
3. If subscription-based, ensure the citation is accurate and complete, and the method of access does not need to be noted in the reference.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J. (2022). [Article requires subscription].</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J. (2022). Title of the article. Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2022.03.015</p>
