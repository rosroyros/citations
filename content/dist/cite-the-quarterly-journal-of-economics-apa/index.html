<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>The Quarterly Journal of Economics-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from The Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE) in APA 7th edition format generally follows standard journal citation rules, but there are some areas where students often encounter confusion. The basic format includes the author(s), year of publication, title of the article, title of the journal in italics, volume number in italics, issue number in parentheses (if available), page range, and the DOI or URL. For example, a citation might look like this: Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, R. L. (2023). The impact of economic policy on growth. <em>The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 138</em>(2), 123-145. https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz001.</p>
<p>A unique aspect of citing QJE articles is the requirement to use the official journal abbreviation, which is often overlooked by students. Although APA generally requires the full title of the journal, for QJE, it's important to consistently use "The Quarterly Journal of Economics" as it appears on the journal's official website and publications. Another point of confusion is the author's initials. When listing multiple authors, up to 20 should be included in the reference list. This is a standard APA rule that some students mistakenly truncate, thinking it applies only to smaller numbers of authors.</p>
<p>Best practices for citing The Quarterly Journal of Economics include double-checking the DOI, as these are often crucial for direct access to articles. Additionally, students should ensure correct usage of italics and capitalization, particularly with journal titles and volume numbers. Finally, regularly consulting the journal’s website for any specific citation guidelines or updates can help avoid errors that stem from outdated practices. By adhering to these standards, students can ensure their citations are both accurate and professional.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
- Use Journal Article format with The Quarterly Journal of Economics specifics<br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-the-quarterly-journal-of-economics">Common Issues When Citing The Quarterly Journal of Economics</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list the authors of articles from The Quarterly Journal of Economics. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Quarterly Journal of Economics often has multiple authors for each article, and these are typically listed in small print at the beginning or end of the article. Additionally, the journal may use initials instead of full first names, which can complicate the identification process for students unfamiliar with standard author listing practices.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the article in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, either through a library database or the journal's website.<br />
2. Look for the author list, which is usually found near the article title or abstract.<br />
3. Ensure you record each author's name as it appears, respecting the order, using full last names and initials if full first names are not provided.<br />
4. For citations, list authors in the same order they appear, separating names with commas and using an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name if there are multiple authors.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J. (2022).<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Doe, J., &amp; Brown, L. (2022).</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-format">Problem 2: Date Format</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes use incorrect date formats when citing articles from The Quarterly Journal of Economics, potentially leading to inaccurate references.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Quarterly Journal of Economics may present dates in various formats depending on whether students access articles online or through print versions. Additionally, the journal might list a range of dates, such as acceptance and publication dates, which can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the publication date, which is usually found near the title or abstract.<br />
2. Use the publication date listed on the journal's website or database entry, even if this differs from in-article dates.<br />
3. Format the date in APA style, which requires only the year for journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> March 2022<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> 2022</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly including URLs for online articles from The Quarterly Journal of Economics, especially when a DOI is available.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
There may be confusion about when to include a DOI versus a URL, and The Quarterly Journal of Economics articles typically have both available. APA guidelines prefer DOIs over URLs when available.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if the article has a DOI, which can be found in the database entry or at the bottom of the first page of the article.<br />
2. Use the DOI in the citation, formatted as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xxx).<br />
3. If no DOI is available, use the stable URL provided by the journal or database.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/xxxxxxx<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.xxxxx/xxxxx</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may have difficulty understanding and navigating access requirements for articles from The Quarterly Journal of Economics, which can impede proper citation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal is often accessed through institutional subscriptions, which might not be obvious to students who are unfamiliar with academic database access protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the journal through your institution's library portal to ensure you have the necessary permissions.<br />
2. Once you have access, locate the article and note whether it is available directly or requires specific credentials.<br />
3. When citing, remember that access date is not required in APA 7th edition, but ensure you have accessed the most stable and final version of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Access requirements do not directly affect citation format in APA, but understanding them can prevent errors in accessing and using the correct article version.</p>
<p>By following these guidelines, students can avoid common citation pitfalls associated with The Quarterly Journal of Economics and ensure their references are accurate and adhere to APA 7th edition standards.</p>
