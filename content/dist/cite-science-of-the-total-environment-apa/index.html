<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Science of The Total Environment-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Science of The Total Environment" (STE) in APA 7th edition involves some specific formatting details that differ slightly from general citation rules. One unique aspect of citing an article from this journal is the inclusion of the article's DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which should be formatted as a hyperlink starting with "https://doi.org/". This is a standard APA requirement but is particularly emphasized in STE to ensure the accessibility and reliability of sources. For the author list, APA 7th edition allows listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, which aligns with general APA guidelines. However, students often mistake this as a limit and might incorrectly truncate the author list early.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises with the punctuation and order of the citation elements. Students sometimes misplace the publication year or incorrectly format the title of the journal and the article. In STE citations, ensure the journal name is italicized and capitalize all major words, while the article title should only capitalize the first word of the title and subtitle. Another potential pitfall is the volume and issue number format, which should be presented as "volume(issue)", without spaces, and followed by a comma before the page range.</p>
<p>To avoid these common errors, students should carefully consult both the "Instructions for Authors" section of the journal's website and the APA 7th edition manual. It’s essential to double-check the DOI and ensure all author names are included correctly. When in doubt, using a citation management tool or the official APA style website can provide additional guidance. These best practices will help ensure the citation is both accurate and compliant with both STE and APA standards.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-science-of-the-total-environment">Common Issues When Citing Science of The Total Environment</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct authors for articles from Science of The Total Environment, particularly when dealing with large collaborative papers.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong><br />
Science of The Total Environment frequently publishes articles authored by large teams of researchers. This can be confusing, especially if the publication uses phrases like "and others" or "et al." in the author list, which are not used in APA citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the article through the journal's website or a database like ScienceDirect.<br />
2. Locate the full list of authors, typically found at the beginning of the article or in the metadata.<br />
3. For APA citations, list the first 20 authors by surname and initials. If there are more than 20 authors, include the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Smith et al., 2023"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Smith, J. A., Brown, B. C., White, C. D., Jones, D. E., Taylor, F. G., Green, H. I., Lee, J. K., Wong, L. M., Harris, N. O., Patel, P. Q., Kim, R. S., Zhang, T. U., Nguyen, V. W., Diaz, X. Y., O'Brien, Y. Z., Ahmed, A. A., Wilson, B. B., Chen, C. C., Park, D. D., &amp; Thompson, E. E. (2023)."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students might be unsure about the correct date format, especially when articles are published online before being assigned to a specific issue.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong><br />
Science of The Total Environment often publishes articles online first, and these may have a different "online publication date" compared to the "print issue date."</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the earliest date available, which is usually the "online publication date."<br />
2. Ensure the date is in the format Year, Month Day, if available. If only the year is given, use that.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "2023"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "2023, March 15"</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls-and-dois">Problem 3: Handling URLs and DOIs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
There can be confusion between when to use a URL versus a DOI, and how to format them in APA style.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong><br />
Science of The Total Environment articles are often accessed online, but not all databases provide a DOI or a stable URL, leading to incorrect citation formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always prefer a DOI over a URL if available, as it is a stable link.<br />
2. Format the DOI as a URL: https://doi.org/xxxxx<br />
3. If no DOI is available, use the most stable URL, usually the one from the publisher's page.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Retrieved from: www.sciencedirect.com/article/pii/S0048969720339345"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.123456"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not have access to full articles, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong><br />
Science of The Total Environment might require institutional access or a subscription, which can limit students' ability to retrieve full-text articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the article through your institution's library portal to ensure full access.<br />
2. If unavailable, consider requesting the article through interlibrary loan or contacting the author directly for a copy.<br />
3. Use the citation provided in the abstract or reference section if full access is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Citation missing volume or issue number due to lack of access.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Science of The Total Environment, 847, Article 123456. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.123456"</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues, students can ensure their citations for Science of The Total Environment are accurate and adhere to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
