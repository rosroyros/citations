<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>The Review of Financial Studies-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing an article from <em>The Review of Financial Studies</em> in APA 7th edition, it is essential to adhere to the standard APA format for journal articles, but there are some nuances to consider. Typically, the citation should include the authors' last names and initials, year of publication, article title, journal name in italics, volume number in italics, issue number in parentheses if applicable, and page range. For example: Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, R. L. (2020). Title of the article. <em>The Review of Financial Studies, 33</em>(2), 123-145. The journal's prestige means it's critical to ensure accuracy and attention to detail in citations.</p>
<p>One notable difference when citing <em>The Review of Financial Studies</em> is the potential for a high number of authors. In APA 7th edition, if an article has up to 20 authors, all should be listed in the reference entry. This can be cumbersome and is a common point of confusion for students, especially when transitioning from APA 6th edition, which limited author listing to seven. Ensure that each author’s name is followed by the appropriate initials and separated by commas, with an ampersand before the final author.</p>
<p>A common mistake students make is neglecting to italicize the journal name and volume number, or improperly formatting the issue number. It’s crucial to remember these details to maintain the citation’s integrity. The best practice is to meticulously check each element of the citation against APA guidelines and ensure consistency throughout your reference list. Using a citation manager can also help automate the formatting process, reducing the risk of errors.</p>
