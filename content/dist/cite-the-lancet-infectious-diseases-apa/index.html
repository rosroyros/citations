<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>The Lancet Infectious Diseases-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> follows the general APA 7th edition guidelines for journal articles, but with attention to some particular details, especially given the prominence and authority of this journal. A key aspect to remember is that when citing articles with multiple authors, APA 7th edition requires listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis. This is crucial as students often mistakenly truncate author lists too early, potentially omitting important contributors from their citations.</p>
<p>Unlike some journals that may have specific citation styles, <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> follows the standard APA format without additional unique requirements. This means that while the citation begins with the authors' last names and initials, followed by the publication year in parentheses, the title of the article should be in sentence case, with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized. The journal name, however, should be italicized and in title case, followed by the volume number (also italicized), issue number in parentheses, and page range.</p>
<p>Common points of confusion arise with the precise formatting of the journal title and the volume and issue numbers. Students may inadvertently apply italics incorrectly or miss the issue number if it's not prominently displayed. To avoid these errors, it’s best practice to double-check each element against the journal’s official publication. Additionally, utilizing citation management tools like Zotero or EndNote can help automate formatting while ensuring accuracy. Always cross-reference the generated citation with APA guidelines to catch any discrepancies specific to <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-the-lancet-infectious-diseases">Common Issues When Citing The Lancet Infectious Diseases</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description">Issue Description</h4>
<p>One common problem students face when citing articles from <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> is identifying all authors correctly. Unlike some journals that list all authors on the article's first page, <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> often includes only the primary authors visibly, with additional authors listed at the end or on a separate page.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens">Why It Happens</h4>
<p>This issue arises due to the journal's formatting choices, which prioritize succinct presentation of the article front matter. This can lead to students inadvertently omitting authors or misordering them in citations.</p>
<h4 id="solution-steps">Solution Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access the Full Article</strong>: Ensure you have the full text, not just the abstract or summary.</li>
<li><strong>Locate the Author List</strong>: Scroll to the end of the article for a complete author list or check the article's supplementary material.</li>
<li><strong>Note the Order</strong>: Take careful note of the order of authors, as this is crucial in APA citation.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Author List in Your Citation</strong>: Include all authors in the reference entry.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="beforeafter-example">Before/After Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before</strong>: Smith, J. (2020). Article title. <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>.</li>
<li><strong>After</strong>: Smith, J., Doe, A., &amp; Zhang, L. (2020). Article title. <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description_1">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Incorrect date formatting is another common problem. Students may struggle with identifying the correct publication date due to the presence of multiple dates, such as online publication date and issue date.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens_1">Why It Happens</h4>
<p><em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> often publishes articles online before they appear in print. This can lead to confusion about which date to use in citations.</p>
<h4 id="solution-steps_1">Solution Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the Correct Date</strong>: Use the earliest publication date available, often found at the top or bottom of the article.</li>
<li><strong>Format According to APA Guidelines</strong>: In APA, dates are formatted as Year, Month Day for periodicals.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="beforeafter-example_1">Before/After Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before</strong>: Smith, J. (2020). Article title. <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>.</li>
<li><strong>After</strong>: Smith, J. (2020, March 10). Article title. <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description_2">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Students often mismanage URLs in their citations, either by including unnecessary parts of the link or by omitting it entirely.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens_2">Why It Happens</h4>
<p><em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> articles may have complex URLs, and students might not know whether to include the DOI or the URL in their citation.</p>
<h4 id="solution-steps_2">Solution Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use DOI if Available</strong>: Always use the DOI in place of a URL if it is available, as it is a more stable link.</li>
<li><strong>Locate the DOI</strong>: Check the article's front page or the publisher's website for the DOI.</li>
<li><strong>Format the DOI Correctly</strong>: Use the format "https://doi.org/xxxx" as per APA guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="beforeafter-example_2">Before/After Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before</strong>: Retrieved from http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30120-9/fulltext</li>
<li><strong>After</strong>: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-9</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description_3">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Access restrictions can make it difficult for students to retrieve full articles, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens_3">Why It Happens</h4>
<p><em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em> is a subscription-based journal, meaning some articles are behind paywalls.</p>
<h4 id="solution-steps_3">Solution Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access Through Institutional Libraries</strong>: Use your university's library portal to access articles.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize Open Access Options</strong>: Look for articles marked as open access directly on the journal's website.</li>
<li><strong>Cite What You Can Access</strong>: If you can only access the abstract, clearly indicate this in your citation.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="beforeafter-example_3">Before/After Example</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before</strong>: Full article citation without access note.</li>
<li><strong>After</strong>: Smith, J. (2020). Article title. <em>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>. Abstract retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-9</li>
