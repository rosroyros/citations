<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Academy of Management Review-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the Academy of Management Review in APA 7th edition, students should adhere to the standard journal citation format but pay special attention to certain nuances that might differ from other journals. The general format for citing a journal article in APA is: Author(s). (Year). Title of the article. <em>Title of the Journal, Volume</em>(Issue), Page range. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy. For Academy of Management Review, you should ensure that the journal title is italicized and capitalized correctly, and that all authors up to 20 are listed by their last names followed by initials, separated by commas, and an ampersand before the last author's name. This is standard for APA, but students often forget to include the DOI, which is crucial for journal articles, including those from the Academy of Management Review.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises from the formatting of the article title and journal title. Remember that in APA, the article title is not italicized and only the first word of the title, the first word after a colon (if any), and proper nouns are capitalized. In contrast, the journal title is fully capitalized and italicized. Additionally, students often mistakenly use the abbreviation "Vol." or "No." which is unnecessary in APA format. Instead, simply list the volume number in italics followed by the issue number in parentheses if available. To avoid these pitfalls, double-check the citation against APA guidelines, and use citation management tools to ensure consistency and accuracy. Always cross-reference with the Academy of Management Review's publication details to obtain the correct volume, issue, and DOI information.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h3 id="step-1-locate-the-article-information">Step 1: <strong>Locate the Article Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Go to the Academy of Management Review journal's website and find the article you want to cite.</p>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure you have all the necessary details: authors' names, publication year, article title, journal title, volume number, issue number, and page range.</p>
<p><strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Use the search function on the journal's website to quickly find the article by typing in keywords, the title, or the authors' names.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-write-the-authors-names">Step 2: <strong>Write the Authors' Names</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Start your citation by writing the authors' last names followed by their initials. If there are multiple authors, separate them with a comma and use an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Smith, J. A., &amp; Johnson, L. B.</p>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: Double-check that the names are spelled correctly and in the correct order as they appear in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 2-3 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-include-the-publication-year">Step 3: <strong>Include the Publication Year</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: After the authors' names, place the publication year in parentheses followed by a period.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Smith, J. A., &amp; Johnson, L. B. (2023).</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Smith, J. A., &amp; Johnson, L. B. (2023). Understanding management theories.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-academy-of-management-review">Common Issues When Citing Academy of Management Review</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-the-correct-authors">Problem 1: Identifying the Correct Author(s)</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often encounter difficulties in identifying the correct author or authors when citing articles from the Academy of Management Review (AMR). This is because AMR articles can have multiple authors with varying contributions, and sometimes the authorship information is not prominently displayed within the article itself.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AMR is a prestigious journal that often features collaborative works. The authorship information may be overshadowed by other details in the article, or students might mistakenly attribute the work to the wrong individual, such as an editor or a guest writer who provides commentary.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the AMR article through a reliable academic database like JSTOR or the AMR website.<br />
2. Navigate to the article’s title page or download the PDF version where the full author list is typically found.<br />
3. Look for a section labeled "Authors" or check the top of the article where the authors' names are often listed.<br />
4. Verify the authors against the article's metadata provided by the database.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Smith, J. (2023). Title of the article. Academy of Management Review."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Johnson, A., &amp; Lee, B. (2023). Title of the article. Academy of Management Review."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-formatting-dates-correctly">Problem 2: Formatting Dates Correctly</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Citing the publication date in APA format can be confusing for AMR articles, especially when the article is an online first publication or has a different publication year than the online release date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AMR sometimes publishes articles online before they appear in print, leading to two possible dates. Students may incorrectly cite the online-first date as the publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check both the online and print publication details.<br />
2. Use the year of the print publication if available; otherwise, use the year the article appeared online.<br />
3. Ensure consistency with the APA format: (Year).</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Johnson, A. (2022, March 15). Title of the article. Academy of Management Review."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Johnson, A. (2023). Title of the article. Academy of Management Review."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls-correctly">Problem 3: Handling URLs Correctly</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with how to correctly include URLs when citing AMR articles, particularly when accessing them through a database or institutional library.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AMR articles are frequently accessed through databases that generate complex URLs. APA guidelines specify using a DOI when available, which can be confusing when both a DOI and a URL are present.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always use the DOI if available, as it is more stable than a URL.<br />
2. If a DOI is not available, use the URL of the journal's homepage rather than a database-specific URL.<br />
3. Format the DOI as: https://doi.org/xxxx</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/1234567"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2023.123456"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements-and-subscription-barriers">Problem 4: Access Requirements and Subscription Barriers</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Some students find difficulties accessing AMR articles due to subscription barriers, leading to incomplete or incorrect citation details.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AMR is a subscription-based journal, and not all students have direct access to its articles, which complicates obtaining accurate citation information.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use your institution's library portal to access AMR articles through subscribed databases.<br />
2. If access is unavailable, consider requesting the article through interlibrary loan services.<br />
3. Utilize citation tools provided by the library or databases that can automatically format the citation in APA style.</p>
<p>By understanding these common issues and following these solutions, students can more accurately and effectively cite articles from the Academy of Management Review in APA 7th edition format.</p>
