<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Journal of Materials Chemistry A-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, students should be aware that this journal follows the guidelines of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), which differ from standard APA formatting. Unlike APA 7th edition, which allows listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, the RSC style requires listing all authors, regardless of the number, which can be a significant deviation for students accustomed to APA's more concise approach. This means that if an article has more than 20 authors, students must include every author in their citation, ensuring no one is omitted.</p>
<p>Another distinction is the order of elements in the citation. In RSC style, the authors’ initials precede their last names, which is the opposite of APA's format. For example, an author cited in RSC style would appear as "J. Doe" instead of "Doe, J." This reversal can be a common point of confusion for students transitioning between citation styles. Additionally, RSC citations do not require a DOI or URL for journal articles, which contrasts with APA's emphasis on including these identifiers for electronic sources.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should carefully consult the RSC style guide when citing articles from the Journal of Materials Chemistry A. It is beneficial to create a template based on a specific journal article from the journal to ensure consistency. Paying close attention to the author name formatting and the sequence of citation elements will help in maintaining accuracy. Using citation management tools that support RSC style can also streamline the process and reduce errors.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) instead of the URL, as it provides a permanent link to the article.<br />
2. If a DOI is not available, use the article URL directly from the journal's website, avoiding database-specific URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved from http://proxy.universitylibrary.edu/article12345</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.1039/C9TA00000A</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
