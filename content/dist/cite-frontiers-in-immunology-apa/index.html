Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Frontiers in Immunology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Frontiers in Immunology" follows the general guidelines of APA 7th edition but with some journal-specific nuances that students should be aware of. A key aspect is that "Frontiers in Immunology" often lists a large number of authors. APA 7th edition requires that for works with up to 20 authors, all names should be listed in the reference. This can be cumbersome but is essential for accuracy. For instance, if an article from "Frontiers in Immunology" has 18 authors, students must list each one by surname followed by their initials, separated by commas, and use an ampersand before the last author’s name.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises when students encounter even more than 20 authors. According to APA guidelines, students should list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis (…), and then add the final author's name. This differs from the typical practice where only the first few authors are listed with an ellipsis, and the last author is included, which is a standard approach in many other citation formats.</p>
<p>To avoid mistakes when citing "Frontiers in Immunology," students should double-check the author count and ensure that all author names are spelled correctly with appropriate initials. It’s also beneficial to use citation management tools or reference generators, which can help in accurately formatting extensive author lists. Additionally, reviewing the journal’s own citation examples can provide clarity and ensure adherence to both APA and journal-specific requirements.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-frontiers-in-immunology">Common Issues When Citing Frontiers in Immunology</h2>
<h3 id="1-identifying-authors">1. Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list authors from articles published in Frontiers in Immunology due to the large number of contributors frequently involved in scientific research.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Immunology, like many scientific journals, often features articles with multiple contributors due to the collaborative nature of scientific research. This can lead to confusion about how many authors to list and in what order.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author List:</strong> On the article's main page, authors are typically listed right below the title. Ensure you have the complete list.<br />
2. <strong>Follow APA Guidelines:</strong> If there are 20 authors or fewer, list all authors. If there are more than 20, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (…), and then add the final author's name.<br />
3. <strong>Check the Order:</strong> Always maintain the order as presented in the article, as this reflects the contribution hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Doe, A.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Doe, A., Brown, L., …, Adams, R.</p>
<h3 id="2-date-formats">2. Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may incorrectly format or completely omit the publication date, which is crucial for APA citation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Immunology may display multiple dates such as received, accepted, and published. Students might be unsure which date is appropriate for the citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Select the Correct Date:</strong> Use the publication date, usually found near the top of the article or under the citation information section.<br />
2. <strong>Format Correctly:</strong> In APA format, the date should appear in parentheses, followed by a period (e.g., (2023).).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 2023/05/01<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023).</p>
<h3 id="3-url-handling">3. URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with how to properly include the URL in their citations, especially when dealing with DOIs.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Frontiers in Immunology provides both a DOI and a URL for its articles, which can confuse students about which to prioritize.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the DOI if Available:</strong> APA 7th edition prioritizes the use of DOIs over URLs. Begin with "https://doi.org/" followed by the DOI number.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the DOI:</strong> This can typically be found on the article's main page under 'Citation.'<br />
3. <strong>If No DOI, Use the URL:</strong> If no DOI is available, provide the full URL of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from www.frontiersin.org/article/10.12345/fimmu.2023.12345<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.12345/fimmu.2023.12345</p>
<h3 id="4-access-requirements">4. Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may worry about how to cite articles that require a subscription or specific access rights.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
While Frontiers in Immunology is an open-access journal, students may sometimes encounter institutional access requirements or misunderstand this status.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Understand Open Access:</strong> Recognize that Frontiers in Immunology articles are freely accessible, so there’s no need to include access dates or retrieval information.<br />
2. <strong>Cite Confidently:</strong> Since these articles are open access, students can cite them without additional notes on access.</p>
<p>By following these steps, students can accurately and effectively cite articles from Frontiers in Immunology, adhering to APA 7th edition guidelines and avoiding common pitfalls associated with this specific source.</p>
