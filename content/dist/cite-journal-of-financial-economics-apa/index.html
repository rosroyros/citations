<p><strong>Journal of Financial Economics-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) in APA 7th edition format, there are a few nuances to keep in mind. Unlike standard APA rules for listing authors—where you list the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis and the final author's name if there are more than 20 authors—JFE articles generally have fewer authors, making this situation less common. However, if you do encounter such a case, adhere to APA's guideline of listing up to 20 authors in full. The JFE requires meticulous attention to detail in the citation format, particularly regarding the journal's title, which should be italicized, and the volume number, which is also italicized—common aspects of APA formatting.</p>
<p>One area where students often get confused is with the issue number. In APA 7th edition, it is only necessary to include the issue number if each issue of the journal begins with page 1. For the Journal of Financial Economics, which typically paginates continuously across issues within a volume, the issue number is not required. Additionally, students should ensure the DOI is formatted as a URL, starting with "https://doi.org/," which is a standard APA requirement but sometimes overlooked.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should consistently verify whether the issue number needs to be included and ensure that the DOI is correctly formatted as a hyperlink. Double-checking these details is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your citation. Always refer to the most recent articles from JFE to see examples of proper citation, as well as the latest APA manual, to ensure compliance with any updates or specific journal guidelines.</p>

     Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Double-check your formatting, ensuring italics and punctuation are correct.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 2-3 minutes<br />
   - <strong>Tip</strong>: Use a citation management tool or online generator for easier formatting.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-journal-of-financial-economics">Common Issues When Citing Journal of Financial Economics</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct authors for articles in the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) due to the way authorship is displayed on the journal's website and in databases.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The JFE, like many academic journals, often lists multiple authors for each article. However, the presentation can vary between the journal's website and databases like PubMed or Google Scholar. Sometimes middle names or initials are included, and at other times, they are omitted, causing confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Article:</strong> Visit the JFE website or a reliable database that hosts the journal.<br />
2. <strong>Check the PDF Version:</strong> Download the full text PDF of the article, as the first page typically lists all authors in the correct order.<br />
3. <strong>Verify on Multiple Platforms:</strong> Cross-reference authors on the JFE website, PDF, and databases to ensure consistency.<br />
4. <strong>Format Correctly in APA:</strong> List all authors in the order they appear, using last names and initials (e.g., Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, J. B.).</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before: J. Smith, John Doe</li>
<li>After: Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, J. B.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-2-using-correct-date-formats">Problem 2: Using Correct Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often use incorrect date formats when citing articles from JFE, which can lead to inconsistencies in their references.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The publication date on the JFE website may display as just the year or include month and year, depending on the article's release format (e.g., online first, in-press, or published).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Date Format:</strong> Check the article's publication details on the JFE site or PDF. Note if it's online first or in a specific issue.<br />
2. <strong>Use APA Format:</strong> If only the year is available, use it. If a month is included, format as Year, Month (e.g., 2023, March).<br />
3. <strong>Update Regularly:</strong> If an article is initially "in press," update your citation once it is assigned to a volume and issue.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before: 2023</li>
<li>After: 2023, March</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls-and-dois">Problem 3: Handling URLs and DOIs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students are often unsure whether to use URLs or DOIs and how to format them correctly in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The JFE provides both URLs and DOIs for articles, but APA 7th edition prefers DOIs due to their permanence and ease of access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the DOI:</strong> Find the DOI on the first page of the PDF or in the article's citation information on the JFE site.<br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI Correctly:</strong> Use the format "https://doi.org/xxxx" (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2023.10.005).<br />
3. <strong>Avoid URLs if DOI is Available:</strong> Only use URLs if no DOI is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before: URL: http://www.journaloffinancialeconomics.com/article/xxxx</li>
<li>After: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2023.10.005</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may face access issues when trying to retrieve articles from the JFE, impacting their ability to cite them accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The JFE is often behind paywalls or requires institutional access, which not all students have.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use Institutional Access:</strong> Log in through your university's library portal to gain access.<br />
2. <strong>Request Access:</strong> If unavailable, request access through interlibrary loan or your institution's library services.<br />
3. <strong>Check Open Access Options:</strong> Some articles may be available as open access; look for these first.</p>
<p>By understanding these common citation issues and solutions specific to the Journal of Financial Economics, students can improve the accuracy and consistency of their APA citations.</p>
