<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Plant Physiology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from the journal <em>Plant Physiology</em> requires adherence to specific formatting guidelines that differ from general citation practices, particularly regarding the number of authors to be listed. In standard APA 7th edition citations, you list up to 20 authors by their last names and initials. However, <em>Plant Physiology</em> has its own rules, which may vary depending on the edition used by the journal at a given time. Typically, <em>Plant Physiology</em> follows a more condensed author listing practice, such as listing only the first author followed by "et al." when there are multiple contributors, though it’s essential to consult the journal’s latest guidelines as these can change.</p>
<p>One of the main differences from standard APA citation rules is how <em>Plant Physiology</em> treats the author list and page numbers. For instance, while APA uses a hanging indent for reference lists, <em>Plant Physiology</em> might have specific page formatting or a different structure for its bibliography. Students often get confused about when to use "et al." and how to format the journal title and volume information. Additionally, the use of DOI numbers in <em>Plant Physiology</em> citations can differ in presentation compared to APA, which strictly requires the DOI or URL at the end of the reference.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should always refer to the latest <em>Plant Physiology</em> author guidelines available on the journal’s website. Paying attention to the journal’s specific examples can offer clarity on formatting nuances. It's also advisable for students to maintain a checklist that includes confirming the correct use of italics, punctuation, and abbreviation conventions as per the journal’s requirements. By cross-referencing their work with published articles in <em>Plant Physiology</em>, students can ensure their citations align with the journal’s expectations, thereby minimizing errors.</p>

4. <strong>List All Authors</strong>: Record all listed authors in the order they appear since APA format requires authors to be listed in the order they contributed.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <em>Before</em>: "Smith, J., University of XYZ, Corresponding Author"<br />
- <em>After</em>: "Smith, J."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students may encounter confusion regarding how to format dates when <em>Plant Physiology</em> provides multiple types of dates such as online publication dates and issue publication dates.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: Journals often provide multiple dates, including when an article was first published online and when it appeared in the print issue. This can lead to uncertainty about which date to use in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Consult the APA 7th Edition Guidelines</strong>: APA guidelines recommend using the year of the online publication if the article is published online first.<br />
2. <strong>Check the Article Information</strong>: On the article's page, identify the date labeled as "Published Online" or similar.<br />
3. <strong>Use the Correct Date</strong>: Use the online publication date for your citation unless instructed otherwise by your instructor.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <em>Before</em>: "Published: January 2023"<br />
- <em>After</em>: "Published Online: November 2022" (use "2022" in citation)</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students may struggle with properly formatting URLs in their citations, especially when URLs are lengthy or include tracking information.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: <em>Plant Physiology</em> articles often come with long URLs that include session identifiers or additional parameters that are not necessary for citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />

2. <strong>Use the DOI Format</strong>: If available, use the DOI in the format "https://doi.org/[DOI number]" as recommended by APA 7th edition.<br />
3. <strong>Trim Unnecessary Parameters</strong>: Remove any tracking codes or session identifiers from the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <em>Before</em>: "http://plantphysiologysource.com/article?id=12345&amp;session=abc123"<br />
- <em>After</em>: "https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.12345"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students might find it difficult to determine if an article requires special access or subscription, affecting how they cite access dates.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: Some content on <em>Plant Physiology</em> may be behind paywalls, and students might access it through institutional subscriptions without realizing it.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Check Access Requirements</strong>: Determine if the article is open access or requires a subscription by checking the article's main page.<br />
2. <strong>Include Access Dates if Necessary</strong>: If the article is behind a paywall and accessed through a library, include the date you accessed the article.<br />
3. <strong>Use APA's Guidelines</strong>: When in doubt, follow APA's rules on including retrieval dates for sources that are not openly accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <em>Before</em>: No access date included.<br />
- <em>After</em>: "Retrieved January 5, 2023, from https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.12345" (if behind a paywall)</p>
