<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Management Science-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing "Management Science" requires adherence to specific formatting rules, which may slightly differ from general citation practices. Management Science, being a journal, typically follows the APA 7th edition guidelines with some nuances. When citing an article from Management Science, ensure you italicize the journal title and volume number. The article title should be in sentence case, while the journal title should be in title case. Unlike some citations that truncate the author list, Management Science articles require listing up to 20 authors before truncating with an ellipsis followed by the final author's name. This can be a point of confusion, as many students mistakenly apply the older APA rule where only the first six authors followed by an ellipsis were required.</p>
<p>Another area where Management Science citations may differ is in the DOI presentation. Ensure the DOI is formatted correctly as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xxxx). A common mistake is omitting the "https://doi.org/" prefix, which is crucial for accessing digital articles directly. Additionally, Management Science, like other academic journals, sometimes includes supplementary materials or online appendices. If these are cited, they should be referenced separately, clearly indicating the material type and its relationship to the main article.</p>
<p>To avoid common pitfalls, students should double-check their citations against the most recent APA guidelines and specific instructions from Management Science itself. It's also beneficial to use citation management tools to ensure format consistency and accuracy. Regularly reviewing the submission guidelines of Management Science can help students stay updated with any changes in citation requirements, ensuring that their work adheres to the latest standards.</p>

<p>When navigating the Management Science journal on the INFORMS Publications website (https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc) to gather citation information, you'll find that the site is organized in a user-friendly manner. Here’s a step-by-step guide to locate the essential citation details needed for your academic work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding the Article:</strong><br />
   - Begin by accessing the main journal page. You can either browse through the latest issues or use the search bar at the top right corner of the page to locate a specific article by entering keywords, titles, or author names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying the Author(s):</strong><br />
   - Once you’ve clicked on your chosen article, you will see the author byline prominently displayed beneath the article title. This section lists all contributing authors, often including their institutional affiliations. This is typically located near the top of the article page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determining the Publication Date:</strong><br />
   - The publication date is displayed directly under the author byline. On the Management Science website, this information is clearly presented right below the article title, making it easy to spot. Look for terms like "Published Online" followed by the date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locating the Article Title:</strong><br />
   - The article title is the most noticeable element on the page, presented at the very top and in a larger font size. This is the first piece of information you’ll see after clicking on an article link from the search results or journal issue listing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the URL:</strong><br />
   - The URL is found in your browser’s address bar at the top of your screen. This is the direct link to the article and should be copied exactly as it appears. URLs on the Management Science website often start with “https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/” followed by a unique identifier for the article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Access Information:</strong><br />
   - If you are accessing the article through an institution, ensure you're logged in via your library's portal to gain full text access. You may notice prompts to log in or check for institutional access if you are not logged in already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Features of Management Science:</strong><br />
   - One unique aspect of this site is the "Metrics" tab located next to the article title. This provides additional data such as citation counts and social media mentions, which can be useful for understanding the article’s impact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently gather the necessary citation information from the Management Science website. Always double-check the details for accuracy, especially when transferring them into citation formats like APA or MLA.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-management-science">Common Issues When Citing Management Science</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often face challenges in identifying the correct authors for articles published in <em>Management Science</em>. This can occur due to complex author listings, such as multiple authors with similar names or the presence of corporate or institutional authors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Management Science</em> often features articles with multiple authors, and the layout can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between them, especially if there are many contributors. Additionally, some articles may attribute contributions to organizations rather than individuals, which can lead to confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Article:</strong> Begin by accessing the full text of the article through the journal’s website or your institutional library.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the Author Section:</strong> Look for a dedicated section at the beginning or end of the article that lists all contributing authors. This is typically near the title or abstract.<br />
3. <strong>Check the Author Order:</strong> Ensure you list authors in the order they appear, as this reflects their contribution hierarchy.<br />
4. <strong>Identify Institutional Authors:</strong> If an article attributes authorship to an organization, ensure you note this as the author in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><em>Before:</em><br />
Doe, J., &amp; Smith, A.</p>
<p><em>After:</em><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; XYZ Corporation.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly formatting the publication date for articles in <em>Management Science</em>, especially when only the year is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Many academic journals, including <em>Management Science</em>, primarily use the year of publication in their citations. However, students may be used to including more specific dates, such as month and day, which are not typically provided for journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Publication Date:</strong> Find the publication year, usually listed near the article title or abstract.<br />
2. <strong>Use Year Only:</strong> In APA 7th edition, use only the year when citing journal articles unless a more specific date is explicitly provided.<br />
3. <strong>Format Consistency:</strong> Ensure consistency by following the same format for all journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><em>Before:</em><br />
Doe, J. (April 2023).</p>
<p><em>After:</em><br />
Doe, J. (2023).</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Another common issue is the incorrect handling of URLs, especially when accessing <em>Management Science</em> articles through institutional databases.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Students might copy the URL from their browser, which often includes session-specific or institution-specific information that is not suitable for citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Stable URL:</strong> Use the digital object identifier (DOI) or the stable URL provided by the journal.<br />
2. <strong>Use DOI Format:</strong> If a DOI is available, format it as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xxxx).<br />
3. <strong>Check Journal Guidelines:</strong> Some journals provide specific citation formats on their website, which can include preferred URL handling.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><em>Before:</em><br />
https://library.university.edu/session123456/article</p>
<p><em>After:</em><br />
https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.1234</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may struggle with citing articles they accessed through institutional subscriptions, leading to confusion about whether to note the access method.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Management Science</em> articles are often accessed through university libraries or other subscriptions, and students may be unsure if they should include this access path in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify Access Path:</strong> Note that in APA 7th edition, most access paths are not required unless they are essential for retrieval.<br />
2. <strong>Exclude Database Information:</strong> Do not include database names or subscription details in your citation.<br />
3. <strong>Focus on DOI/URL:</strong> Prioritize using the DOI or stable URL, which is universally accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><em>Before:</em><br />
Retrieved from ProQuest Database.</p>
<p><em>After:</em><br />
https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.1234</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation issues, students can enhance the accuracy and professionalism of their bibliographies when referencing <em>Management Science</em>.</p>
