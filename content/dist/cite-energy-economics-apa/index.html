<p><strong>Energy Economics-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from the journal <em>Energy Economics</em> can present unique challenges due to its specific formatting requirements, which differ slightly from general APA 7th edition guidelines. One notable distinction is the way <em>Energy Economics</em> handles author lists. When citing a paper from this journal, it is crucial to list all authors up to 20, using their last names followed by their initials, separated by commas. This is in line with standard APA practices for sources with up to 20 authors, where ellipses are used only when citing more than 20 authors, retaining the first 19 authors' names and the last author's name.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion for students arises when distinguishing between the journal's specific citation requirements and general APA guidelines. For instance, <em>Energy Economics</em> may have additional requirements for formatting tables, figures, or supplementary materials, so it is essential to review the journal's specific author guidelines in addition to standard APA rules when preparing citations. Additionally, students often mistakenly apply ellipses prematurely or misformat author names, which can lead to incomplete or incorrect citations.</p>
<p>To avoid these common mistakes, students should first consult the <em>Energy Economics</em> author guidelines for any unique requirements beyond APA standards. Familiarizing themselves with these specifics and cross-referencing with APA rules can help ensure accurate citations. It is also beneficial to double-check each author's name and order, as accurate representation of the source is critical for academic integrity. Using citation management tools that support APA 7th edition can further streamline the process, reducing the possibility of errors.</p>

This guide will take you through the process, ensuring you understand each component and how to find the necessary information.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-need">What You Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>Access to the article you want to cite</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of APA formatting</li>
<li>A computer or device with internet access</li>
<li>A note-taking app or document for drafting your citation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the Authors</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Look for the names of the authors listed at the beginning of the article. Authors are typically found under the title.<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure you have the full names of all authors. If there are two authors, format them as "Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B." For more than two authors, only list the first author's name followed by "et al." <br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 2 to 3 minutes.<br />
   - <strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Use a highlighter to mark the author names for easier reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine the Publication Year</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Find the publication year usually located near the author names or at the top of the article.<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Confirm that you have the correct year, as this is essential for your citation.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 1 to 2 minutes.<br />
   - <strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Write down the year as you find it to prevent mistakes later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locate the Article Title</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Identify the title of the article. It is usually in bold or italics and found directly beneath the authors' names.<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Make sure to write the title in sentence case, meaning only the first word and any proper nouns are capitalized.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 1 to 2 minutes.<br />
   - <strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Copy and paste the title into your draft, then format it correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find the Journal Title and Volume Information</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Look for the journal's title, which is typically italicized and appears after the article title. Take note of the volume number, which usually follows the journal title.<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure the journal title is in italics and the volume number is correctly noted.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 2 to 3 minutes.<br />

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for the Issue Number and Page Range</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Look for the issue number, which is often in parentheses right after the volume number. Then, find the page range of the article listed after the issue number, usually indicated by "pp." or just a dash.<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure you have both the issue number and the page range. If there is no issue number, you can omit it from your citation.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 2 to 3 minutes.<br />
   - <strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Write down the page range directly after finding it, so you do not forget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find the DOI</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Locate the DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is usually at the bottom of the article or on the journal’s website. It typically starts with "https://doi.org/".<br />
   - <strong>Verification</strong>: Confirm that you have the complete DOI. If there is no DOI, you may need to use the URL of the journal's main page instead.<br />
   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 2 to 3 minutes.<br />
   - <strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Bookmark the webpage containing the DOI for quick reference later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compile Your Citation</strong><br />
   - <strong>Action</strong>: Using the gathered information, format your citation according to the template provided: <br />
   Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx.<br />

   - <strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 3 to 5 minutes.<br />
   - <strong>Tip for Efficiency</strong>: Use a citation generator tool to help format your citation, but always double-check for accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2 id="4-access-requirements">4. Access Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="issue-description_3">Issue Description</h3>
<p>Students often cite articles without considering access restrictions, which can lead to incomplete citations if the source cannot be verified.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-happens_3">Why It Happens</h3>
<p>Energy Economics articles might be behind paywalls, requiring subscriptions or institutional access, complicating direct access to verify citations.</p>
<h3 id="step-by-step-solution_3">Step-by-Step Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access the Article:</strong> Use institutional access through libraries or request the article via interlibrary loan if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Verify the Citation:</strong> Ensure you have all details (authors, title, journal, volume, issue, pages) before citing.</li>
