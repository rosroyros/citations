<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>American Sociological Review-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing the <em>American Sociological Review</em> (ASR) in APA 7th edition, students should pay attention to specific details that are unique to this source. Generally, the formatting for citing articles from ASR follows the standard APA guidelines for journal articles. This includes listing the authors' last names followed by their initials, the year of publication in parentheses, the title of the article in sentence case, the title of the journal in italics and title case, the volume number in italics, the issue number in parentheses (if applicable), and the page range. However, ASR's emphasis on sociological context means that students should be meticulous about ensuring that all elements reflect precision and consistency, especially when dealing with multiple authors.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of citing ASR articles is the potential number of authors. APA 7th edition allows the listing of up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, which is often seen in comprehensive sociological studies published in ASR. It's crucial to list all authors up to 20 in the order they appear, using commas to separate names and an ampersand before the last author's name. Students frequently confuse the use of "et al." in such contexts, but it should only be applied when there are more than 20 authors. </p>
<p>To avoid common pitfalls, students should double-check their formatting for accuracy, particularly the journal's title and volume/issue numbers, as these are often overlooked. They should also ensure that digital object identifiers (DOIs) are formatted correctly, using the full URL form (e.g., https://doi.org/...). Best practices include using citation management tools to keep track of sources and consulting the APA manual or trusted academic resources for complex citations. By adhering to these guidelines, students can effectively manage the nuances of citing the <em>American Sociological Review</em> and avoid common errors.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-american-sociological-review">Common Issues When Citing American Sociological Review</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly identifying the authors of articles from the American Sociological Review (ASR). This can lead to improperly formatted citations or missing attributions.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The ASR is a peer-reviewed academic journal that often features articles with multiple authors, sometimes listed in a non-standard order. Additionally, when accessing articles through databases or library systems, author names can be displayed inconsistently, leading to confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always access the article directly from the ASR website or a reliable academic database like JSTOR or ProQuest.<br />
2. Locate the article's title page or the first page where the author names are prominently listed.<br />
3. Carefully note the order of authors as they appear; this is the order they should be cited in your reference list.<br />
4. If a database displays authors differently, refer back to the original ASR article for accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Johnson, K. </p>
<p><strong>Example After:</strong><br />
Smith, A., Johnson, K., &amp; Doe, J.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes incorrectly format publication dates, including the year, month, and day, when citing articles from the ASR.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ASR typically publishes articles quarterly, and while the year is always required in an APA citation, the exact month or season is sometimes overlooked.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the volume and issue number of the article from the ASR.<br />
2. Use the publication date as it appears in the journal, typically in the format of year only (e.g., 2023), since ASR articles are not usually tied to specific months or days.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before:</strong><br />
American Sociological Review. (April 2023).</p>
<p><strong>Example After:</strong><br />
American Sociological Review. (2023).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Including URLs in citations can be problematic, especially when students use URLs that are specific to their institution’s library or databases.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Often, students copy URLs from their browser’s address bar, which may include session-specific or institution-specific tokens that are not accessible to others.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) whenever possible, as it provides a stable, permanent link to the article.<br />
2. If no DOI is available, use a direct URL from the publisher's site, not from a database URL.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before:</strong><br />
Retrieved from https://universitylibrary.edu/session123/article456</p>
<p><strong>Example After:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224231123456</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students might cite articles they accessed through subscription-based platforms without realizing that these articles are not freely accessible to all readers.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles from ASR are often accessed through university library subscriptions, leading to the mistaken belief that all readers can access them via the same links.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Mention the access method if necessary, but prioritize using DOIs, which bypass access issues.<br />
2. If a DOI is not available and a URL must be used, ensure it is a stable URL from the journal's website, and note that access may be required.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before:</strong><br />
Available at American Sociological Review.</p>
<p><strong>Example After:</strong><br />
Note: Access to this article may require a subscription or purchase.</p>
<hr />
<p>By addressing these issues, students can improve the accuracy and accessibility of their citations when referencing articles from the American Sociological Review. Each step emphasizes careful verification and usage of appropriate citation resources, ensuring compliance with APA guidelines.</p>
