<h2 id="quick-reference-advanced-functional-materials-citations">Quick Reference: Advanced Functional Materials Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Functional Materials-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Advanced Functional Materials" requires attention to detail, as it often deviates from general citation rules in subtle but important ways. In APA 7th edition, when citing a work with up to 20 authors, you list each author by their last name followed by their initials, separated by commas, and use an ampersand (&amp;) before the final author's name. For example: Smith, J., Johnson, A. B., &amp; Lee, C. D. However, "Advanced Functional Materials" citations often involve a significant number of authors due to the collaborative nature of scientific research. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that each author's name is correctly listed and formatted, maintaining the sequence as per the publication.</p>
<p>One of the common points of confusion for students is the handling of the volume and issue numbers as well as the DOI (Digital Object Identifier). For "Advanced Functional Materials," always include the volume number in italics and the issue number in parentheses immediately after, if available, followed by a comma and the page range. The DOI should be presented as a URL, starting with "https://doi.org/". An example citation might look like this: Smith, J., Johnson, A. B., &amp; Lee, C. D. (2023). Title of the article. <em>Advanced Functional Materials, 33</em>(16), 1234-1256. https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should double-check the author list and ensure the DOI is correctly formatted as a hyperlink. Consistently refer to the latest APA guidelines and cross-verify with authoritative examples, especially when dealing with complex author lists. These practices help maintain accuracy and uphold the integrity of academic work.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-advanced-functional-materials">Common Issues When Citing Advanced Functional Materials</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list authors for articles from "Advanced Functional Materials" due to the journal's format and presentation style on its website and database listings.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
"Advanced Functional Materials" frequently features articles with multiple authors, sometimes exceeding ten contributors. The authors are usually listed in a compact format, which can be confusing, especially when initials are used instead of full names.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Navigate to the article's landing page on the "Advanced Functional Materials" website.<br />
2. Look for the "Authors" section, which is typically located near the top of the page, just below the article title.<br />
3. Click on "Show all authors" if available, to reveal the complete list.<br />
4. For APA citation, list up to 20 authors by their last name followed by initials. For more than 20 authors, list the first 19, followed by an ellipsis (...), and then the last author’s name.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Doe, A., Johnson, B., et al.</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Doe, A., Johnson, B., Davis, C., Lee, D. E., Patel, F. G., ... Zhao, Y.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often use incorrect date formats due to confusion between the publication date and the online availability date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
"Advanced Functional Materials" often publishes articles online before they are assigned to a specific issue. These articles might have multiple dates listed (e.g., accepted date, online publication date).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the earliest date of publication available, typically the “Published Online” date for the initial citation.<br />
2. If no clear "Published Online" date is available, use the "Accepted" date with caution, ensuring it is the latest step before publication.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> (2023).  </li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> (2023, March 15).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently omit crucial URL components or use unstable URLs when citing articles from "Advanced Functional Materials."</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal uses DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers), which provide a stable link to the article, but students often mistakenly copy URLs from their browser's address bar.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the DOI on the article's page, usually found near the article title or in the citation section.<br />
2. Format the DOI as a URL: <code>https://doi.org/</code> followed by the DOI number.<br />
3. Use this stable URL in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.journalwebsite.com/article/view/12345</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202301234</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes cite articles incorrectly due to restricted access, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
"Advanced Functional Materials" is often behind a paywall or requires institutional access, which can lead to challenges in retrieving full citation details if not accessed through a university library or similar resource.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the article through your institution's library portal to ensure full access to citation information.<br />
2. If access is restricted, include as much information as possible and seek access through interlibrary loans or by contacting the author for a copy.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Advanced Functional Materials article</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> Advanced Functional Materials, 33(5), Article e123456. https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202301234</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps and using the examples as a guide, students can effectively navigate the unique challenges presented by citing "Advanced Functional Materials" and ensure their citations meet APA 7th edition standards.</p>
