<p><strong>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH), it's essential to follow the general APA 7th edition guidelines while paying attention to the journal's specific nuances. A unique aspect of citing IJERPH articles is ensuring you correctly format the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), presented in the URL format (https://doi.org/). This is standard for all APA citations but is particularly emphasized by IJERPH due to its open-access nature, ensuring articles are easily accessible.</p>
<p>One area where IJERPH citations differ from standard APA rules is in the listing of authors. APA 7th edition allows for up to 20 authors to be listed in the reference entry before using an ellipsis to denote additional authors. Students often find it challenging to keep track of this large number, especially when transitioning from the 6th edition, which allowed only seven authors before the ellipsis. Remembering to list up to 20 and then using an ellipsis before the final author's name is crucial for IJERPH citations.</p>
<p>To avoid common pitfalls, students should carefully double-check each author's initials and surnames in the order they appear on the publication. Additionally, it's important to verify the DOI provided in the citation to ensure it's accurate and functional. As a best practice, always access articles directly from the IJERPH website or a reputable database to ensure you have the most up-to-date information, especially since open-access articles may be updated more frequently. Consistency in formatting and attention to detail are key to mastering citations for this journal.</p>

- The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health site is user-friendly, featuring a search bar that allows you to locate articles by title, author, or keywords. Once you find your article, you can also access supplementary materials or related works via links often provided in the article's sidebar or at the end of the article.</p>
<p><strong>6. Additional Unique Features:</strong><br />
- The journal's website often includes metrics such as the number of views or citations for each article. While not necessary for a basic citation, this information can be useful for understanding the impact or reach of the research.<br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-international-journal-of-environmental-research-and-public-health">Common Issues When Citing International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list all authors for articles published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH), especially when there are multiple authors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles in IJERPH frequently have numerous contributing authors, and the author list can be extensive. The journal's interface may present author names in a compact format, making it challenging to determine the correct order and full names.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Article:</strong> Open the article directly on the IJERPH website.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the Author Section:</strong> Scroll to the top of the article where the authors are listed.<br />
3. <strong>Copy the Full List:</strong> Ensure you capture all authors as they are presented, noting the order and any middle initials.<br />
4. <strong>Use "et al.":</strong> For in-text citations in APA format, use "et al." when there are more than three authors, after listing the first authors' last name.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong><br />
- Before: Smith, J., &amp; Others.<br />
- After: Smith, J., Johnson, P. L., Nguyen, T. H., &amp; Wong, R. Y.</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often misformat the publication date, especially when additional components like the month or day are provided.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJERPH might list the publication date as a full date (e.g., January 15, 2023) rather than just the year. Students may overlook the APA requirement to format this correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Complete Date:</strong> Look for the full publication date in the citation information section.<br />
2. <strong>Format for APA:</strong> Use the year only for the reference list citation. If the full date is necessary (e.g., for a direct quote), use the format (Year, Month Day).</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong><br />
- Before: January 15, 2023<br />
- After: 2023</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often fail to properly include or format the URL when citing online articles from IJERPH.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJERPH articles are accessed online, and students may copy the URL from the address bar, which can be excessively long or include session-specific components.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOI if Available:</strong> Always prefer the DOI over URLs in APA references.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the DOI:</strong> Check the article's citation information for a DOI.<br />
3. <strong>Format Correctly:</strong> Use the format <code>https://doi.org/DOI</code> if a DOI is present. If not, use the direct URL from the stable link provided on the journal's page.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong><br />
- Before: https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/123456/0987<br />
- After: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph12345678</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may cite articles without realizing some are behind paywalls or require institutional access, leading to confusion or incorrect citation practices.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IJERPH is an open-access journal, but users accessing through different platforms might encounter access issues.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Verify Access:</strong> Ensure the article is accessed directly through the IJERPH website or a platform providing open access.<br />
2. <strong>Check University Access:</strong> If encountering a paywall, verify if your institution provides access through its library portal.<br />
3. <strong>Cite Appropriately:</strong> Ensure the citation reflects the version of the article you accessed, whether it's an open-access version or through institutional access.</p>
<p><strong>Example Before/After:</strong><br />
- Before: Accessed via a third-party site requiring login.<br />
- After: Accessed directly through IJERPH or institution library portal.</p>
<p>By attending to these common citation problems unique to the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, students can ensure their references are accurate and adhere to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
