<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Journal of Health and Social Behavior-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the <em>Journal of Health and Social Behavior</em> (JHSB), it is crucial to adhere to both the journal's specific formatting requirements and the guidelines outlined in the APA 7th edition. While JHSB follows APA style, a unique aspect is its emphasis on detailed author attribution, particularly in extensive collaborative works. APA typically prescribes listing up to 20 authors by their last name and initials. JHSB adheres to this, ensuring all authors are acknowledged, which can be particularly nuanced when dealing with large-scale studies common in health and social behavior fields.</p>
<p>A notable difference in JHSB citations compared to standard APA rules is the journal's preference for more detailed author identification, sometimes requesting additional initials if authors share common surnames. This can cause confusion for students who may not be accustomed to verifying such details. Additionally, the journal might require expanded author lists even if APA's "et al." could suffice after the 20th author in a standard reference.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should carefully check the author list against the publication's author affiliations and ensure all contributing authors are correctly cited. It's beneficial to use citation management tools that allow for customization to accommodate JHSB's specific needs. Furthermore, always refer directly to the journal’s submission guidelines, as they may have particular instructions for manuscript preparation that influence citation formatting. This diligence ensures accuracy and adherence to both APA standards and the journal's unique requirements.</p>

<p>To effectively locate citation information on the Journal of Health and Social Behavior website, follow these detailed steps. This guide will help you find the author, publication date, article title, and URL/access information for citing your sources accurately.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding the Author(s):</strong><br />
   When you access an article on the Journal of Health and Social Behavior website, the author byline is prominently displayed at the top of the article page. Look for the section just below the article title where the authors' names are listed. The names are typically hyperlinked, which can lead you to additional information about the author(s) if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying the Publication Date:</strong><br />
   The publication date is usually located just beneath the author byline. On the Journal of Health and Social Behavior site, this is often formatted as "First Published" or "Published Online," followed by the month, day, and year. This information is crucial for your citation as it indicates when the article was made publicly available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locating the Article Title:</strong><br />
   The article title is prominently featured at the top of the page. It is typically in a larger font size than the rest of the text. Ensure you capture the full title as it appears, including any subtitles, as this will be essential for your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the URL:</strong><br />
   The URL or web address is found in your browser's address bar. This is the unique link that directs you to the specific article page on the Journal of Health and Social Behavior website. When citing an online article, it is important to include the complete URL to enable others to access the same source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigating the Journal's Site for Additional Information:</strong><br />
   If you need more detailed publication information, scroll down to the bottom of the article page. Here, you may find additional details like the volume, issue number, and page range, which are occasionally listed under a section titled "Article Information" or similar. This can be particularly helpful for constructing a complete reference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently gather the necessary citation information for articles from the Journal of Health and Social Behavior. Remember, accurate citations contribute to the credibility and traceability of your academic work.

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-journal-of-health-and-social-behavior">Common Issues When Citing Journal of Health and Social Behavior</h2>
<p>Certainly! Citing academic journals correctly can be challenging, and the Journal of Health and Social Behavior (JHSB) presents specific issues that students often encounter. Below are common citation problems that students face with JHSB, along with solutions guided by APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and format the authors of articles from JHSB. This challenge may stem from multiple authors or unconventional name formats.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JHSB articles can have multiple authors, and the author names might be presented differently on the journal's website compared to other databases. Additionally, for articles with more than 20 authors, APA 7th edition guidelines require a specific listing format.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify all authors listed in the article. Use the "Cite" tool or look directly at the article’s first page for accurate author names.<br />
2. List up to 20 authors in your reference. For articles with more than 20 authors, list the first 19 followed by an ellipsis (…) and then the final author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Johnson, A., et al.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Johnson, A., Brown, B., … Williams, Z.</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Inconsistent date formats can lead to improper citation, especially when students are unsure whether to use the article's publication date or the online posting date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JHSB may publish articles online ahead of print, leading to confusion about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the publication date listed at the top of the article or in the citation information section. If the article is only available online as a preprint, use the online publication date.<br />
2. Format the date as Year, Month Day if available.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> (2023)<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023, March 15)</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Properly formatting and using URLs in citations can be challenging, particularly with URLs that change or are lengthy.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JHSB articles accessed through databases might have URLs that are session-based or temporary, leading to broken links.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available instead of a URL. The DOI provides a permanent link to the article.<br />
2. Place the DOI at the end of the citation in the format: https://doi.org/xxxx</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/xyz<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231111111</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often face issues accessing JHSB articles, leading to incomplete or incorrect citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
JHSB may require a subscription or institutional access, causing students to rely on summaries or incomplete information.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access through a university library portal or request the article through interlibrary loan if direct access is unavailable.<br />
2. Always verify citation details using the full article text.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Citing from an abstract or secondary source.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Citing directly from the article: "Smith, J. (2023). Title of article. <em>Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 64</em>(1), 10-20. https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465231111111"</p>
<p>By addressing these issues methodically, students can ensure accurate and complete citations for their academic work, adhering to APA 7th edition guidelines and respecting the unique challenges posed by the Journal of Health and Social Behavior.</p>
