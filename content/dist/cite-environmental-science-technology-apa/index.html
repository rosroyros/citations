<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Science &amp; Technology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from Environmental Science &amp; Technology (ES&amp;T), a journal published by the American Chemical Society (ACS), it's important to follow the specific formatting requirements that differ slightly from standard APA citation rules. In ES&amp;T, the format for citing journal articles typically includes the authors' last names followed by their initials without spaces or periods, the year of publication in parentheses, the title of the article in italics, the journal name in italics, the volume number in bold, and the page range. Unlike APA, where up to 20 authors are listed, ES&amp;T requires the listing of all authors up to a certain number (usually ten); if there are more, list the first ten followed by “et al.” This differs from APA's rule of listing up to 20 authors before using "et al."</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises from the differences in punctuation and formatting between ACS and APA styles, such as the lack of spaces between initials in author names and the italicization of article titles rather than journal names in APA. Students often mistakenly apply APA rules to ES&amp;T references, resulting in formatting errors. Furthermore, ES&amp;T citations require specific attention to detail with volume and issue numbers, where the volume is bolded—a requirement not present in APA.</p>
<p>Best practices for citing ES&amp;T include carefully reviewing the ACS style guide and using citation management tools that support ACS formatting. Students should double-check their citations against published articles in ES&amp;T to ensure consistency and accuracy. Familiarity with the nuances of ACS style, particularly regarding the order and presentation of information, will help avoid common pitfalls.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-environmental-science-technology">Common Issues When Citing Environmental Science &amp; Technology</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often have trouble identifying the correct authors when citing articles from Environmental Science &amp; Technology (ES&amp;T). This problem arises due to the presence of multiple contributing authors and the way they are listed on the journal's webpage.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ES&amp;T, like many scientific journals, often involves collaborative research, leading to numerous authors per paper. The listing format on the website can be confusing, as it may not clearly distinguish between authors and contributors or editors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Navigate to the article page on the ES&amp;T website.<br />
2. Look specifically for the section labeled "Authors," typically located near the article's title or abstract.<br />
3. Copy the full list of authors as presented, ensuring to maintain the order. In APA format, list up to 20 authors. If there are more than 20, list the first 19, an ellipsis, and then the final author.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: Smith, J., Doe, J., Johnson, A., Lee, C., &amp; Patel, R.</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently struggle with formatting dates correctly, particularly when the article's publication date is not explicitly stated.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ES&amp;T articles often have several dates listed: submission, acceptance, and publication. This can be confusing as students may not know which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the publication date, which can usually be found at the top of the article page or in the citation information section.<br />
2. Format the date in the APA style as Year, Month Day (e.g., 2023, March 15).</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: March 2023</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: 2023, March 15</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Handling URLs correctly for ES&amp;T can be challenging, especially when accessing articles through institutional databases rather than directly from the journal's website.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
URLs can vary depending on access points. Direct links can be long and complex, while database access often provides proxy URLs that are temporary.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. If accessing directly from the ES&amp;T website, use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) as the URL for stability and persistence.<br />
2. Format the DOI as a URL: https://doi.org/[DOI number].</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es100000a</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: https://doi.org/10.1021/es100000a</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Accessing full-text articles can be problematic when students encounter paywalls or restricted access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ES&amp;T is a subscription-based journal. Many articles are behind paywalls, requiring institutional access or payment.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access ES&amp;T through your university's library portal to ensure you have access via institutional subscriptions.<br />
2. If access is still restricted, consider using interlibrary loan services or contacting the author directly for a copy.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Student attempts to access directly and encounters a paywall.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Student accesses through their university library's portal, ensuring unrestricted access to the full text.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Citing Environmental Science &amp; Technology requires careful attention to detail. By understanding and addressing these common issues—author identification, correct date usage, stable URL handling, and access requirements—students can effectively navigate the specific challenges posed by this journal. Remember, adhering to APA 7th edition guidelines ensures clarity and consistency in academic writing.</p>
