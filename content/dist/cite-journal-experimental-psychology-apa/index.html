<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Journal of Experimental Psychology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the Journal of Experimental Psychology, students should follow the APA 7th edition guidelines, which generally apply to all APA-style citations. However, there are specific nuances that may cause confusion. One key aspect of citing this journal is that it often involves multiple authors, and APA 7th edition allows for listing up to 20 authors in the reference list. Each author's last name should be followed by their initials, separated by commas, with an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name. This is a departure from the previous edition, which only required listing the first six authors before using "et al." for additional authors. </p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises when students are unfamiliar with the shift to listing up to 20 authors, as they might mistakenly revert to the outdated "et al." format. Additionally, students should ensure they correctly format DOIs, which should be presented as URLs (e.g., https://doi.org/...). This is crucial for electronic sources such as those commonly found in the Journal of Experimental Psychology. Best practices include carefully checking each author's name spelling and order, as inaccuracies can undermine the credibility of your reference. Also, pay attention to italicizing the journal title and volume number, while ensuring proper punctuation and spacing throughout. By adhering to these specific guidelines, students can avoid common pitfalls and ensure their citations are both precise and professional.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

This section will list all contributing authors, often in a hyperlinked format that may lead to their respective profiles or other publications.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-publication-date">Finding the Publication Date</h3>
<p>The publication date is another crucial piece of citation information found on the article page. On the Journal of Experimental Psychology site, this date is traditionally located just below the authors’ names, often alongside the journal issue and volume number. It is formatted clearly, typically as month, day, and year, ensuring easy identification and accuracy when citing.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-the-article-title">Identifying the Article Title</h3>
<p>The article title is one of the most prominent features on the article page. It appears at the top of the page in bold or larger font than other text. This makes it easy to spot immediately upon accessing the article. Ensure you record the title exactly as it appears, preserving any special formatting such as italics or punctuation, as this is critical for an accurate citation.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-the-url">Accessing the URL</h3>
<p>The URL, essential for accessing the article, is found in your browser’s address bar at the top of the window. For students and researchers citing online sources, it’s important to note the URL accurately. Be sure to copy the entire link, starting with “https://” to ensure that your reader can easily access the source. Additionally, if you are accessing the article through a university library or a similar portal, make sure to provide the direct URL to the article rather than a proxied version.</p>
<h3 id="unique-features-of-the-journal-of-experimental-psychology">Unique Features of the Journal of Experimental Psychology</h3>
<p>The Journal of Experimental Psychology is distinct in its structured presentation of articles, making it easy to find and identify citation details quickly. The website often offers abstracts and full-text views, which provide comprehensive details in a consistent layout. Moreover, the journal's affiliation with the American Psychological Association (APA) means that articles are formatted to meet high academic standards, aligning with APA’s citation guidelines.</p>
<p>By understanding these specific elements and their locations, you can efficiently gather all necessary citation information from the Journal of Experimental Psychology’s website, ensuring your references are both complete and accurate.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-journal-of-experimental-psychology">Common Issues When Citing Journal of Experimental Psychology</h2>
<h3 id="common-citation-problems-with-journal-of-experimental-psychology">Common Citation Problems with Journal of Experimental Psychology</h3>
<p>Citing articles from the Journal of Experimental Psychology can present unique challenges due to its specific formatting and access requirements. Below, I outline common issues and provide practical solutions to help students accurately cite this source according to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<h4 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h4>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify all authors, especially in articles with multiple contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Journal of Experimental Psychology often features collaborative research with numerous authors. The challenge arises when distinguishing between co-authors and contributors listed in other sections, such as acknowledgments.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the article through your library or database.<br />
2. Scroll to the article's beginning, where the authors' names are listed prominently.<br />
3. Use only the names presented under the article title, ignoring any additional mentions elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before: "John Doe, Mary Smith, etc."<br />
After: "Doe, J., Smith, M., &amp; Johnson, L."</p>
<h4 id="problem-2-formatting-dates-correctly">Problem 2: Formatting Dates Correctly</h4>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Incorrect date formats are a frequent issue, particularly when articles include specific publication dates beyond the year.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Journal of Experimental Psychology may list an online publication date and a print issue date, leading to confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the publication date, often found near the article title or abstract.<br />
2. Use the year of the most recent publication format available (usually the online date).<br />
3. If only the year is available, cite just the year.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before: "Published on 08/15/2023"<br />
After: "(2023)."</p>
<h4 id="problem-3-handling-urls-and-dois">Problem 3: Handling URLs and DOIs</h4>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often incorrectly format URLs and DOIs, or fail to include them when required.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles may be accessed through various platforms, and the Journal of Experimental Psychology often provides both a DOI and a URL.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always use the DOI when available. It should be presented as a URL, beginning with "https://doi.org/" followed by the unique DOI number.<br />
2. If no DOI is available, include the URL where the article can be accessed.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before: "www.example.com/article"<br />
After: "https://doi.org/10.1037/xyz123"</p>
<h4 id="problem-4-access-requirements-and-paywalls">Problem 4: Access Requirements and Paywalls</h4>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may face issues accessing full articles due to paywalls, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Journal of Experimental Psychology is often part of subscription-based databases, limiting access to full-text articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use your institution's library portal to access the journal for free.<br />
2. If unavailable, request the article through interlibrary loan or reach out to your instructor for guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Access Note:</strong><br />
Always ensure you have full access to the article to retrieve accurate citation details.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>By addressing these common issues—identifying authors, formatting dates, handling URLs/DOIs, and navigating access barriers—students can effectively cite articles from the Journal of Experimental Psychology. These steps ensure compliance with APA 7th edition guidelines and help maintain the integrity of academic work.</p>
