<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Chemical engineering journal-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the <em>Chemical Engineering Journal</em>, students should pay close attention to the specific formatting requirements that may differ slightly from standard APA guidelines. One unique aspect of citing from this journal is the emphasis on listing all authors when there are 20 or fewer, which aligns with the APA 7th edition's general rule. However, for articles with more than 20 authors, the rule is to list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name. This can be a common point of confusion, as some students may mistakenly believe that only the first few authors need to be listed before using an ellipsis.</p>
<p>Another area where the <em>Chemical Engineering Journal</em> may differ from standard citation rules is in the presentation of DOI numbers. While APA format requires the use of a URL format for DOIs (https://doi.org/...), some students may encounter older articles where DOIs are presented in a different format. It's important for students to convert these into the correct URL format. Additionally, the journal often includes specific details, such as article numbers in lieu of page ranges, which should be noted in the citation. </p>
<p>To avoid common pitfalls, students should double-check author listings and ensure proper DOI formatting. Utilizing citation management tools that are updated with the latest APA guidelines can help streamline this process. It’s also advisable for students to consult the journal's specific guidelines or their institution’s library resources for any additional citation nuances specific to the <em>Chemical Engineering Journal</em>. By adhering to these practices, students can enhance the accuracy and professionalism of their citations.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-chemical-engineering-journal">Common Issues When Citing Chemical engineering journal</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list the authors of articles from the Chemical Engineering Journal. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Chemical Engineering Journal, like many academic journals, lists multiple authors, often in small print or in a non-standard order. Additionally, the presence of corporate or institutional authors can complicate identification.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Authors:</strong> Open the full text of the article, as author details are usually listed prominently at the beginning. If you are viewing the article online, look for a "PDF" or "Full Text" option to ensure you see all author names.<br />
2. <strong>List Correctly:</strong> Follow the APA format for multiple authors. For up to 20 authors, list all names. Beyond that, list the first 19, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., Doe, J., Brown, A., &amp; Green, B. (2023).</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently misuse date formats, leading to confusion and incorrect citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The Chemical Engineering Journal, like many scientific journals, often indicates the date the article was received, revised, and accepted. Students might mistakenly use these dates instead of the publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Correct Date:</strong> Locate the publication date on the article's first page or in the citation information on the journal's website. Only use the publication date for your citation.<br />
2. <strong>Format Correctly:</strong> In APA style, use the year only for journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J. (Accepted June 2023). Title of article. Chemical Engineering Journal.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J. (2023). Title of article. Chemical Engineering Journal.</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Handling URLs for online articles can be problematic, especially concerning DOI numbers and stable links.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Chemical Engineering Journal articles often have both a stable URL and a DOI. Students might not know which to use or how to format them correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOI:</strong> Always prioritize the DOI over a URL, as it provides a permanent link to the article.<br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI:</strong> Always format the DOI as follows: https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved from http://www.chemicalengineeringjournal.com/article/123456789</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2023.012345</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Accessing articles from the Chemical Engineering Journal can sometimes be challenging due to subscription walls or institutional access requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal often requires institutional or personal subscriptions to access full articles, which can be a barrier for students without access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access through Institution:</strong> Use your university's library portal to access the journal. Most institutions have subscriptions to major journals.<br />
2. <strong>Interlibrary Loan:</strong> If direct access is not available, request the article through interlibrary loan services provided by your library.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example (Student struggling):</strong><br />
I can't access the full article; therefore, I can't cite it properly.</p>
<p><strong>After Solution:</strong><br />
Accessed through [University Library Portal], enabling proper citation.</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues with specific solutions tailored to the Chemical Engineering Journal, students can ensure their citations are both accurate and complete, aligning with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
