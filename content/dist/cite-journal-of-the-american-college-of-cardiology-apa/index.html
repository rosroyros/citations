<p><strong>Journal of the American College of Cardiology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing the <em>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</em> (JACC) in APA 7th edition involves specific nuances that differ slightly from general citation practices, particularly when listing authors. For JACC, standard APA guidelines apply: when citing a work with up to 20 authors, list all authors by their last name followed by initials. However, a common point of confusion arises due to the journal's high author count, where the APA 7th edition limits the listing to 20 authors. If a paper has more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis, and then the last author's name. This requirement remains consistent with APA's general rules, but students often mistakenly include all authors or truncate the list incorrectly.</p>
<p>Another specific formatting requirement for JACC is the usage of italics for the journal title and volume number. The issue number, if available, should not be italicized but should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the volume number. The digital object identifier (DOI) should be included in the citation, formatted as a URL, which is a common practice that sometimes gets overlooked.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should always verify the complete list of authors and ensure they follow the "first 19, then ellipsis, then last author" rule for works exceeding 20 authors. It’s also essential to ensure correct formatting of journal titles and volume numbers. Employing citation management tools can help automate this process; however, manual checks are advisable to ensure adherence to JACC-specific nuances. This approach helps maintain accuracy and consistency in academic writing.</p>

<p><strong>Locating the Article</strong>: Once on the JACC homepage, use the search bar to find the specific article you need. You can search by title, author, or keywords. Alternatively, navigate through the journal's volume and issue archives to locate your article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Author Information</strong>: Open the full-text view of the article. The author byline is usually positioned prominently at the top of the article page, directly underneath the title and any subheadings. Look for a list of authors, which may include their affiliations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date</strong>: The publication date is typically located near the top of the article page, close to the title and author information. It may be formatted as "Published: [Month] [Day], [Year]" or simply "[Month] [Year]".</p>

If accessing through an institutional login or a database like ScienceDirect, ensure you have proper permissions or use a DOI link if provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Features</strong>: JACC articles often include a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is a stable link that can be used in citations.

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-journal-of-the-american-college-of-cardiology">Common Issues When Citing Journal of the American College of Cardiology</h2>
<h1 id="common-citation-problems-in-citing-the-journal-of-the-american-college-of-cardiology">Common Citation Problems in Citing the Journal of the American College of Cardiology</h1>
<p>When citing articles from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), students often encounter specific challenges related to the format and interface of this particular source. Below, I outline common issues and provide practical solutions in line with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h2>
<h3 id="issue-description">Issue Description</h3>
<p>Students frequently struggle with identifying the correct authorship details, especially when articles have numerous contributors.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-happens">Why It Happens</h3>
<p>JACC articles often have multiple authors, sometimes exceeding 20. Determining the correct order and listing them accurately can be cumbersome.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access the Article</strong>: Go to the JACC website and locate the article.</li>
<li><strong>Identify All Authors</strong>: Check the article’s title page for a complete list of authors. Note the order in which they are presented.</li>
<li><strong>APA 7th Edition Guidance</strong>: For articles with up to 20 authors, list all authors in the reference. For more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis (…), and then the final author's name.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: Doe, J., Smith, A., et al.<br />
<strong>After</strong>: Doe, J., Smith, A., Johnson, B., Lee, C., Adams, S., Brown, D., … Green, F.</p>
<h2 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h2>
<h3 id="issue-description_1">Issue Description</h3>
<p>Students often misrepresent the publication date, which can lead to inaccuracies in the citation.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-happens_1">Why It Happens</h3>
<p>JACC articles may display multiple dates, such as "received," "accepted," and "published online," which can confuse students about which date to use.</p>
<h3 id="solution_1">Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Locate the Publication Date</strong>: On the article's webpage, find the section labeled "Published Online."</li>
<li><strong>Use the Correct Date</strong>: According to APA guidelines, use the "Published Online" date if the article has not yet appeared in print. If it has, use the print publication date.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example_1">Example</h3>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: (2023, January 5).<br />
<strong>After</strong>: (2023, March 15).</p>
<h2 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h2>
<h3 id="issue-description_2">Issue Description</h3>
<p>Incorrectly handling URLs in citations is a common problem, particularly when articles are accessed through databases or institutional portals.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-happens_2">Why It Happens</h3>
<p>Students might use URLs from subscription databases, which are not accessible to everyone, instead of a DOI or a public URL.</p>
<h3 id="solution_2">Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find the DOI</strong>: Always use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) instead of a URL if available, as it provides a permanent link to the article.</li>
<li><strong>Format the DOI</strong>: Use the format "https://doi.org/" followed by the DOI number.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example_2">Example</h3>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: Retrieved from https://www.jacc.org/content/early/2023/03/15/<br />
<strong>After</strong>: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.03.015</p>
<h2 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="issue-description_3">Issue Description</h3>
<p>Students often cite articles that require a subscription or institutional access, which can hinder verification by others.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-happens_3">Why It Happens</h3>
<p>JACC content is typically behind a paywall, making it inaccessible to those without subscriptions.</p>
<h3 id="solution_3">Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check Access</strong>: Before citing, ensure you have legitimate access through your institution or a personal subscription.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Access Information</strong>: When necessary, mention in the text that the article is behind a paywall, but do not include this in the reference.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example_3">Example</h3>
<p>When discussing the article in your paper, mention:<br />
"This article is available through institutional access from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology."</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges with a focus on the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, students can ensure their references are accurate, complete, and compliant with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
