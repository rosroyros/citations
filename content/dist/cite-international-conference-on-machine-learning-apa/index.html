<p><strong>International Conference on Machine Learning-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing papers from the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) requires attention to specific details that differ from general citation formats. In APA 7th edition, conference papers are treated as proceedings, necessitating the inclusion of information such as the conference name, location, and date. A typical citation includes the authors' names, publication year, paper title in italics, followed by "In" and the editors' initials and last names (if available), the proceedings title in italics, the page range in parentheses, and the publisher. For ICML papers, the publisher is often the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of ICML is the frequent use of arXiv preprints by authors, which can cause confusion. If a paper is available both in the conference proceedings and on arXiv, students should cite the published version from the proceedings if possible. This can be challenging as students might mistakenly use information from arXiv due to its accessibility. Therefore, it is crucial to verify the paper's official publication details from the ICML proceedings.</p>
<p>To avoid common pitfalls, students should familiarize themselves with the ICML proceedings website to access accurate citation information. Best practices include double-checking details like conference location and dates, and ensuring the correct formatting of editors' names and proceedings titles. Understanding these nuances will help students accurately cite ICML papers and adhere to APA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-international-conference-on-machine-learning">Common Issues When Citing International Conference on Machine Learning</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify the authors of papers from the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) proceedings. This confusion arises because the papers are part of a larger conference proceeding, and multiple authors are frequently involved.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
ICML conference papers often have numerous contributors, and the author listing can vary between the conference's official website and the publisher’s archive. Additionally, students may mistakenly cite the editors of the conference proceedings instead of the actual authors of the individual papers.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Locate the Paper</strong>: Access the specific paper through the ICML website or the publisher’s platform (e.g., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research).<br />
2. <strong>Identify the Authors</strong>: Look for the list of authors typically found at the top of the paper, just below the title. Ensure that you are listing the actual authors of the paper, not the editors of the proceedings.<br />
3. <strong>List the Authors Correctly</strong>: Follow the APA 7th edition format: Last name, First initial. Middle initial. (if provided).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: Citing editors as authors: "Smith, J., &amp; Editor, A. (Eds.)."<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: Correct author citation: "Doe, J., &amp; Roe, P."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Students often incorrectly format the date when citing ICML proceedings, using the date of the conference rather than the publication date of the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
The conference date and the publication date are often close, but they are not always the same. Students may inadvertently use the date the conference took place as opposed to the publication year of the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Check the Publication Date</strong>: Ensure you are using the publication year, which is usually available on the first page of the paper or in the citation information provided by the publisher.<br />
2. <strong>Format the Date</strong>: Use the year of publication in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: "Doe, J. (2023, July)."<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: "Doe, J. (2023)."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Citing the correct URL for ICML papers can be perplexing, especially when multiple access points exist, such as the conference website or publisher’s database.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
ICML papers can be accessed through different platforms, and URLs can vary. Some platforms might require a subscription, while others might offer open access, leading to confusion over which URL to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Determine Access</strong>: Identify whether the paper is open access or requires a subscription.<br />
2. <strong>Use a Stable URL</strong>: Preferably use a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available, as it provides a permanent link.<br />
3. <strong>Include the Access Date if Necessary</strong>: For non-permanent URLs, include the date you accessed the document.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: Using a temporary URL: "Retrieved from http://temporarylink.com"<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: Using a DOI: "https://doi.org/10.1234/icml2023.56789"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Determining and noting access requirements for ICML papers can be challenging, particularly when accessing the material through institutional databases.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
ICML papers may be freely available on the conference website while also being hosted on subscription-based platforms, leading to confusion about how to note access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Check the Source</strong>: Determine if the paper is freely available on the conference website or only through institutional access.<br />
2. <strong>Indicate Access Information</strong>: If the paper is freely accessible, note this in your reference. If accessed through a subscription, mention the access method if required by your institution's guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: No access note: "Retrieved from https://conferencewebsite.com"<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: Indicating open access: "Retrieved from https://conferencewebsite.com (Open Access)"</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues with specific strategies tailored to the ICML's unique format and interface, students can ensure their citations are both accurate and adhere to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
