<h2 id="quick-reference-business-strategy-and-the-environment-citations">Quick Reference: Business Strategy and the Environment Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Business Strategy and the Environment-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Business Strategy and the Environment" (BSE) in APA 7th edition follows the general guidelines for journal articles, but there are some nuances that students should be aware of. In APA format, you list up to 20 authors for a single work. For BSE, this rule applies, and you should ensure all authors are included in the citation for any article with 20 or fewer authors. The format would be: Author(s) Last name, Initials. (Year). Title of the article. <em>Business Strategy and the Environment</em>, Volume(Issue), page range. https://doi.org/xxxx. Pay special attention to the DOI, as it is a persistent identifier that provides a direct link to the article, and BSE articles typically include them.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises with the treatment of the article title and journal name. In APA format, the article title is written in sentence case, meaning only the first word of the title, the first word after a colon, and proper nouns are capitalized. However, students often mistakenly capitalize all significant words, which is incorrect. The journal name, however, is capitalized and italicized. Best practices for citing BSE articles include double-checking author order and ensuring DOI accuracy. Additionally, students should verify they have not mistakenly italicized the article title, which is a frequent error. Keeping these details in mind will help students avoid common pitfalls and ensure their citations are precise and in line with APA standards.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
- Use Journal Article format with Business Strategy and the Environment specifics<br />
- Locate citation info on Business Strategy and the Environment's website<br />
- Handle Business Strategy and the Environment's unique formatting requirements</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-business-strategy-and-the-environment">Common Issues When Citing Business Strategy and the Environment</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to identify the correct authors when citing articles from the journal "Business Strategy and the Environment" because the journal sometimes features papers with multiple authors, international collaborations, and occasionally editorial pieces without clear attribution.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This issue arises because the journal's articles frequently involve collaborations among several researchers, and the listing format can differ slightly based on authors' affiliations and contributions. Moreover, editorial notes or special issues may not always have distinct author identifications at first glance.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Visit the journal's official website or database where the article is published.<br />
2. Locate the article's title and click to open the full record.<br />
3. Scroll to find the "Authors" section, typically located near the title or abstract.<br />
4. Note down the authors exactly as listed, maintaining the order and format (e.g., Surname, Initials).</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: "John Doe et al."</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: "Doe, J., Smith, A. B., &amp; Lee, C."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formatting">Problem 2: Date Formatting</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Another common problem is using incorrect date formats, especially when the publication date is not clearly stated, or when differentiating between online publication and print versions.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The confusion arises because "Business Strategy and the Environment" may list different dates for online availability and print publication. Additionally, some articles might only list the year, while others provide a full date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check the article's citation information on the journal's webpage.<br />
2. Use the date of the online publication if available; otherwise, use the print publication date.<br />
3. Format the date according to APA 7th edition guidelines: (Year, Month Day) if the full date is available.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: "(2023)"</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: "(2023, March 15)"</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with determining when and how to include URLs, especially when the articles are accessed through institutional databases rather than directly from the journal's website.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This confusion is due to APA's guidelines which state that URLs should be included for online sources, but not for articles accessed via academic databases that do not provide a DOI or stable URL.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. If the article has a DOI, use it in place of a URL. Format it as "https://doi.org/xxxx".<br />
2. If no DOI is available and the article is accessed from the journal's site, use the stable URL.<br />
3. Do not include URLs for database-specific links.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Incorrect: "Retrieved from http://universitylibrary.database.com/article"</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Correct: "https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.1234"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may face issues accessing articles due to subscription requirements, leading to incomplete citation data.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
"Business Strategy and the Environment" is often accessed through institutional subscriptions, which may limit access to certain users, complicating citation efforts for those without direct access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use your institution's library portal to access the journal.<br />
2. If full access is unavailable, use interlibrary loan services or request the article through academic networks.<br />
3. Once accessed, ensure the citation includes all necessary components: author(s), date, title, journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers.</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges, students can enhance the accuracy and reliability of their work when referencing "Business Strategy and the Environment," aligning their citations with APA 7th edition standards.</p>
