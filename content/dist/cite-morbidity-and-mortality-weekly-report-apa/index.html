<p><strong>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) in APA 7th edition requires attention to specific formatting nuances that differ from typical journal article citations. The MMWR is a publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and when citing it, the CDC is treated as the author. The correct format is: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>, Volume(Issue), Page range. URL. Unlike standard journal articles which list individual authors, the organizational author format simplifies the citation process when the CDC is the sole author.</p>
<p>One common area of confusion is the treatment of the CDC as the author, which can lead to incorrect listings of individual article authors if students aren't familiar with this convention. Additionally, students often struggle with the correct formatting of issue numbers and URLs, particularly when these details are not immediately clear on the publication's webpage. Best practices include closely following the title capitalization rules and ensuring the publication date is accurately reflected. Also, students should verify the presence of a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and use it in place of a URL if available, as this is preferred in APA format.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should always double-check that the CDC is consistently used as the author in their reference list, and they should ensure that all publication details are sourced directly from the MMWR website or database where the report was accessed. This approach, coupled with a careful review of the APA guidelines specific to government reports, will help maintain accuracy and adherence to citation standards.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report">Common Issues When Citing Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-the-author">Problem 1: Identifying the Author</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify the author when citing articles from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This issue arises because the MMWR is published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and articles may not list individual authors. Instead, the CDC or a specific department within it is often the author.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Organizational Author:</strong> If individual authors are not listed, use "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" as the author.<br />
2. <strong>Check for Specific Departments:</strong> Sometimes, a specific CDC department is credited. Use the department name if it is mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> [No clear author identified]<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students are confused about how to correctly format dates for MMWR citations, particularly when dealing with weekly publications.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
MMWR articles are often published weekly, and specific dates need to be accurately reflected in the citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the Year, Month Day Format:</strong> For MMWR articles, the correct format is YYYY, Month Day. This reflects the specific publication date.<br />
2. <strong>Locate the Date on the Article:</strong> The publication date is usually found at the top of the article or in the citation information provided by MMWR.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023)<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023, October 12)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often misuse or fail to include the correct URL when citing MMWR articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The URLs for MMWR articles can be long and complex, and there is uncertainty about whether to include them and how to format them.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Include a Direct URL:</strong> Always include a direct link to the article if available. This aids in retrieval.<br />
2. <strong>Format URLs Correctly:</strong> Ensure the URL is complete and starts with "https://". Do not add a period at the end of the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7001e1.htm.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7001e1.htm</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may be unsure about how to handle access information in MMWR citations, especially if articles are freely available.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
MMWR articles are publicly accessible, which can lead to confusion about how to denote access requirements in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>No Access Date Required:</strong> Since MMWR articles are freely accessible and not behind a paywall, there is no need to include an access date.<br />
2. <strong>Ensure Open Access Noted:</strong> If needed, clarify that the source is publicly available for reassurance.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved October 10, 2023, from https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7001e1.htm<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7001e1.htm</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-morbidity-and-mortality-weekly-report">Frequently Asked Questions About Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How can I navigate the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report’s website to find the necessary information for my citation?</strong></p>
<p>A: Visit the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) website and locate the article you wish to cite. Ensure you have the title, volume and issue number, publication date, and page numbers, which are usually listed at the top or bottom of the article page. Access these details to construct your citation accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I handle the unique author formats when citing articles from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in APA?</strong></p>
<p>A: MMWR articles often list the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the corporate author. In such cases, use "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" as the author in your citation.

<p><strong>Q: What is the correct way to deal with the publication date format for Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in APA citations?</strong></p>
<p>A: The publication date for MMWR should be listed as year, month, and day (e.g., 2023, October 15). This format helps to pinpoint the exact release date of the weekly report, which is crucial for articles that are time-sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there specific URL and access requirements to consider when citing the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report?</strong></p>
<p>A: Include the direct URL to the article on the MMWR or CDC website in your citation. Since the MMWR is publicly accessible, no retrieval date or database name is needed. Ensure the URL leads directly to the full text for ease of verification by your readers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report differ from other journal article sources in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unlike other journals, MMWR often uses the CDC as the corporate author and includes more detailed publication dates. Additionally, MMWR articles are government documents, which means they are often freely available online, negating the need for database retrieval details, but necessitating correct URL inclusion.</p>
