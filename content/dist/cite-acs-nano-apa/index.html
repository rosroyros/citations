<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>ACS Nano-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from ACS Nano requires adherence to specific formatting guidelines that align with the American Chemical Society (ACS) style, which diverges from the more general citation formats students might encounter, such as APA or MLA. One notable distinction is that ACS Nano citations often need to list all authors when there are 20 or fewer, which is a point of divergence from APA's guideline to list only the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis and the final author's name when there are more than 20 authors. In ACS Nano, each author's surname is followed by their initials without periods, and authors are separated by semicolons rather than commas. This meticulous listing ensures clarity and gives credit to all contributors.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises in the sequence and punctuation of these citations. Students frequently overlook the use of italicized journal titles and volume numbers in ACS style, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and professionalism. Additionally, ACS Nano requires the use of DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) when available, positioned at the end of the citation. Best practices include double-checking that the author list and their initials are correctly formatted and ensuring that all elements, such as the article title, journal name, year, volume, and page range, are accurately presented. Utilizing citation management tools or referring to the ACS style guide can help students navigate these specifics and avoid common pitfalls, ensuring their references meet the journal's standards.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-acs-nano">Common Issues When Citing ACS Nano</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and format author names when citing articles from ACS Nano. This can be due to the multiple authorship common in scientific papers, where numerous contributors are listed.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACS Nano, like many scientific journals, often features articles with long lists of authors, sometimes exceeding 10 or more. The format in which authors are presented on the publication can also vary, causing confusion about the order and completeness of names to include.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Navigate to the article's landing page on the ACS Nano website.<br />
2. Locate the "Authors" section, usually found near the top of the article.<br />
3. List all authors in the order they appear. According to APA 7th edition, for articles with up to 20 authors, include all names. For articles with more than 20 authors, list the first 19, insert an ellipsis, and then add the final author’s name.<br />
4. Format names as "Last Name, Initial(s)."</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Brown, P., &amp; Others.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J. A., Brown, P. D., Lee, E. F., ... Thompson, G. L.</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with the correct date format for ACS Nano citations, resulting in inconsistent citation styles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACS Nano articles often list publication dates in various formats, such as month-day-year or year-month-day, leading to confusion about which format to use in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Find the publication date on the article's page, usually near the title or authors.<br />
2. Use the APA 7th edition format, which requires the year of publication only.<br />
3. Ensure the date is enclosed in parentheses immediately following the author list, followed by a period.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 2023-05-15<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023).</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Properly handling URLs for ACS Nano articles can be confusing for students, especially with DOI links versus standard URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACS Nano articles are often accessed through institutional libraries with proxy links, or students may not know whether to use a DOI or the direct URL.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always prefer using the DOI when available. Locate it on the article's page, often listed as "DOI" under the title or abstract.<br />
2. Format the DOI as a URL: <code>https://doi.org/XX.XXXXX/XXXXX</code>.<br />
3. If no DOI is provided, use the stable URL of the article from the ACS Nano site, avoiding any proxy links.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> https://proxy.library.edu/acs.nano.10.1021<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.XXXXXXX</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes misunderstand the access requirements for articles from ACS Nano, leading to incorrect citation of sources they can't properly review.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACS Nano is a subscription-based journal, meaning many articles are behind paywalls. Students might cite abstracts or summaries without accessing the full article.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if your institution provides full access to ACS Nano articles. Use library resources or consult a librarian if needed.<br />
2. If full access is not available, avoid citing sections of the article you cannot read in full. Seek alternative sources or request access through interlibrary loan services.<br />
3. Always cite the version you have accessed. If only an abstract is available, indicate this in your citation.</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues with clear steps and examples, students can accurately and confidently cite ACS Nano articles in their academic work.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-acs-nano">Frequently Asked Questions About ACS Nano</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How do I find the necessary citation information for an article from ACS Nano on their website?</strong></p>
<p>A: When you navigate to an article on ACS Nano's website, look for the "Citation" or "References" section typically found near the abstract or at the bottom of the page. This section will often provide citation details such as the full list of authors, title, publication date, volume, issue, and page numbers. You can also use citation tools offered on the website to generate an initial APA citation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I format the author names when citing an article from ACS Nano, considering their unique author formats?</strong></p>
<p>A: In APA format, list the authors' last names followed by their initials. ACS Nano articles may have numerous authors, so include up to 20 authors in the reference list, using an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name. If there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19, followed by an ellipsis, and then the last author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I correctly format the publication date for an article from ACS Nano, considering their specific date formats?</strong></p>
<p>A: In APA format, you should include the year of publication in parentheses immediately after the author's names. If the article provides a more specific date, such as a month and day, include that in the format: (Year, Month Day).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the URL and access requirements when citing an article from ACS Nano?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you accessed the article online, include the URL of the article at the end of the citation. If a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is provided, use it in place of the URL with the format: https://doi.org/[DOI]. Ensure that the URL or DOI leads directly to the article.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing an article from ACS Nano differ from citing other journal articles in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: While the basic structure of journal article citations remains consistent in APA, ACS Nano articles may feature specific nuances, such as comprehensive author lists and detailed publication dates. Additionally, ensure you accurately capture the journal's title, "ACS Nano," which is distinct from other journals, and always prioritize the use of a DOI if available for more reliable referencing.</p>
