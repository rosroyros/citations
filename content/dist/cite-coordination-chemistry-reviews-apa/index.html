<p><strong>Coordination Chemistry Reviews-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from Coordination Chemistry Reviews in APA 7th edition, it's important to note that the journal itself does not mandate a unique citation style that deviates from standard APA guidelines. However, students should be mindful of the general APA rules which stipulate that when listing multiple authors, you should list up to 20 authors, providing their last names and initials. For instance, if an article has up to 20 authors, all should be listed in the reference, which can be a source of confusion for students accustomed to the APA 6th edition, where only up to seven authors were listed before using "et al." for subsequent authors.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises with the formatting of long author lists and ensuring commas, ampersands, and periods are correctly placed. For instance, when listing authors, use commas to separate names and an ampersand before the final author's name if there are multiple authors. Also, ensure that the journal title is italicized and each major word is capitalized. </p>
<p>Best practices for citing Coordination Chemistry Reviews include double-checking the DOI, as this unique identifier should always be included in the citation when available, formatted as a hyperlink beginning with "https://doi.org/". Additionally, pay close attention to the volume and issue numbers, ensuring they are correctly formatted: the volume number should be italicized, followed by the issue number in parentheses, without italics. By adhering to these guidelines and regularly reviewing APA 7th edition updates, students can avoid common pitfalls and ensure accurate citations.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-coordination-chemistry-reviews">Common Issues When Citing Coordination Chemistry Reviews</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue</strong>:<br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list authors when citing articles from Coordination Chemistry Reviews. This confusion arises due to the presence of multiple contributing authors with complex names, which can be difficult to organize correctly in a citation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
Coordination Chemistry Reviews, like many scientific journals, frequently publishes articles with multiple authors, sometimes exceeding ten or more. This can make it challenging for students to determine how to list all authors, especially when dealing with truncation rules in APA format.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Access the Article</strong>: Start by accessing the full article through a database that offers Coordination Chemistry Reviews, such as ScienceDirect.<br />
2. <strong>Examine Author List</strong>: Locate the complete list of authors, typically found at the beginning of the article.<br />
3. <strong>Apply APA Rules</strong>: In APA 7th edition, list up to 20 authors in the order they appear. If there are more than 20, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (…), and then add the final author.<br />
4. <strong>Use Correct Format</strong>: Ensure that each author’s name is inverted (last name, initials). </p>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: Smith, J., Doe, A., &amp; Black, W. </p>
<p><strong>After</strong>: Smith, J., Doe, A., Black, W., Green, T., Brown, S., … White, R.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue</strong>:<br />
Students may use incorrect date formats when citing articles from Coordination Chemistry Reviews, leading to inaccuracies in reference lists.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
Scientific journals often have complex publication histories, with online publication dates differing from print dates. Coordination Chemistry Reviews may list different dates for received, accepted, and published statuses.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Identify the Publication Date</strong>: Use the article’s most recent publication date, usually available on the article’s webpage or the PDF version.<br />
2. <strong>Format Correctly</strong>: In APA 7th edition, use the format Year, Month Day if all components are available, or just the Year if only the year is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: 08/15/2023</p>
<p><strong>After</strong>: 2023, August 15</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue</strong>:<br />
Students often mishandle URLs in citations, either by omitting them or using incomplete links to Coordination Chemistry Reviews articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
URLs for articles in academic journals can be lengthy and complex, sometimes leading to errors in transcription. Additionally, students may not be aware of the necessity of including a DOI or stable URL.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Locate DOI</strong>: Always prefer the DOI over a URL. It is a stable identifier that can often be found on the article’s webpage or the PDF version.<br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI</strong>: In APA 7th edition, present the DOI as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxx).<br />
3. <strong>Include Access URL</strong>: If a DOI is unavailable, use the article’s stable URL directly from the publisher’s site.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: www.sciencedirect.com/journal/coordination-chemistry-reviews</p>
<p><strong>After</strong>: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2023.04.015</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue</strong>:<br />
Students sometimes misunderstand the access requirements for articles from Coordination Chemistry Reviews, leading to issues with sourcing articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
Coordination Chemistry Reviews is often accessed through institutional subscriptions, meaning students without access permissions may encounter paywalls.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
1. <strong>Check Institutional Access</strong>: Verify if your institution has a subscription. Use library portals or ask librarians for assistance.<br />
2. <strong>Use Interlibrary Loan Services</strong>: If access is unavailable, request the article through interlibrary loan services provided by most academic libraries.<br />
3. <strong>Explore Open Access Options</strong>: Occasionally, articles are available via open access or pre-print repositories. Check for these options.</p>
<p>Understanding these challenges and applying the solutions will help students accurately cite articles from Coordination Chemistry Reviews, ensuring their work adheres to APA 7th edition standards.</p>
