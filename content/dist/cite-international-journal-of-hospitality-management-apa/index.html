<p><strong>International Journal of Hospitality Management-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the International Journal of Hospitality Management using APA 7th edition, students must pay special attention to certain nuances that may differ from standard citation rules. A key distinction is that this journal often includes a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for its articles, which should be formatted as a hyperlink starting with "https://doi.org/". This is a mandatory part of the citation if available, as it provides a direct, permanent link to the content. Unlike some other journals, which may not always utilize DOIs, failing to include this element can lead to an incomplete citation.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect is that the International Journal of Hospitality Management follows the general APA guideline for author lists, but students often get confused with the handling of multiple authors. For articles with up to 20 authors, list all authors by their last name followed by initials. This is consistent with APA’s stipulation, but students frequently encounter issues with correctly ordering and punctuating these names. Ensure commas separate authors and that an ampersand (&amp;) precedes the last author’s name.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should consistently check for a DOI and correctly apply the rule of listing up to 20 authors. Best practices include using the journal's official website or databases like PubMed to verify citation details and employing citation management tools to format references accurately. Always cross-reference with the latest APA guidelines to ensure compliance, especially when dealing with complex author lists or electronic sources.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-international-journal-of-hospitality-management">Common Issues When Citing International Journal of Hospitality Management</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often face challenges when trying to accurately identify and list authors for articles from the International Journal of Hospitality Management. This is because journal articles may have multiple authors, and their names can sometimes be presented in an order that is confusing or unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
The International Journal of Hospitality Management, like many academic journals, presents author names in varying formats. These can include different naming conventions based on cultural differences, usage of initials, or non-standardized formats across different articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author Information:</strong> Start by locating the author section, usually found at the beginning of the article, either on the cover page or immediately after the abstract.<br />
2. <strong>Follow the Author Order:</strong> List authors in the exact order they appear in the article. This order is significant and must be preserved in citations.<br />
3. <strong>Use Full Names When Available:</strong> Use full names if provided. If only initials are given, ensure they are used correctly in the citation.<br />
4. <strong>Consult the Journal’s Author Guidelines:</strong> Check if the journal provides any specific guidance on how authors should be listed.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Incorrect:</strong> Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J.<br />
- <strong>Correct:</strong> Smith, John., &amp; Doe, Jane.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with the correct date format when citing articles, as they may be unsure about which date to use and how to format it correctly according to APA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
The confusion often arises because the publication date can be found in multiple places and in different formats, such as online publication date, print issue date, or even a range of dates if the issue covers multiple months.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Correct Date:</strong> Use the year of publication as listed on the article’s main page or in the citation information provided by the journal.<br />
2. <strong>Format According to APA:</strong> In APA 7th edition, the format is "Year, Month Day" if detailed, or just "Year" if only that is provided.<br />
3. <strong>Use Consistent Format:</strong> Always ensure consistency in how dates are presented across all citations.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Incorrect:</strong> 2023-07-15<br />
- <strong>Correct:</strong> 2023</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently make mistakes when including URLs in citations, often using incorrect links or failing to format them properly in the reference list.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
The International Journal of Hospitality Management can have articles available across different platforms, such as the publisher's website or database access points. This can lead to confusion regarding which URL to include.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the DOI if Available:</strong> Always prefer the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) over URLs, as it is a permanent and stable link.<br />
2. <strong>Find the Correct URL:</strong> If a DOI is not available, use the URL from the publisher’s website rather than a database link.<br />
3. <strong>Format the URL Correctly:</strong> Ensure there are no line breaks or unnecessary punctuation in the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Incorrect:</strong> http://www.database.com/article123<br />
- <strong>Correct:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2023.102345</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Accessing articles behind paywalls or requiring institutional access can be problematic, leading to improper citation due to lack of complete information.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
The International Journal of Hospitality Management is often accessible through academic institutions or subscription services, meaning students may not always have direct access to the necessary details for citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use Institutional Access:</strong> Leverage your academic institution’s library resources to access the full articles.<br />
2. <strong>Request Articles through Interlibrary Loan:</strong> If access is unavailable, use interlibrary loan services offered by your institution.<br />
3. <strong>Cite What You Can Access:</strong> If you are unable to access the full article, cite the abstract or summary you have access to, but clearly note it is not the full article.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Incorrect:</strong> Citing without knowing full details.<br />
- <strong>Correct:</strong> Citing with all available details and noting limitations if necessary.</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues with specific solutions, students can improve the accuracy and reliability of their citations for the International Journal of Hospitality Management.</p>
