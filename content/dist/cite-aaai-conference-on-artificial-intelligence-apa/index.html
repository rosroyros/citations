<p><strong>AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence involves certain unique considerations compared to general source type citations. In APA 7th edition, conference proceedings are typically treated like book chapters if they are part of a larger collection, or as periodicals if they are published in a journal format. However, the AAAI Conference papers are often standalone documents accessible online, which can confuse students who are used to differentiating between books and journals. For AAAI papers, the citation should include the author(s), year of the conference, title of the paper, the phrase "In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence," volume and issue number if available, page range, and DOI or URL.</p>
<p>One of the main differences when citing AAAI Conference papers compared to standard citations is the emphasis on the conference name and the proceedings title, which must be italicized. Students often miss italicizing these elements or incorrectly format the conference title, leading to inconsistent citations. Moreover, students might confuse the volume and issue numbers with those of journal articles; however, these should be clearly identified as part of the proceedings' details.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes when citing AAAI Conference papers, students should pay close attention to the conference's publication details. It is crucial to verify whether the papers are published in a journal-like format or as standalone documents online. Best practices include double-checking each element of the citation for completion and accuracy, ensuring proper italicization, and using the DOI or URL for accessibility. Familiarizing themselves with a few examples from the AAAI digital library can also provide clarity and help students efficiently navigate these specific citation requirements.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-aaai-conference-on-artificial-intelligence">Common Issues When Citing AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
When citing papers from the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, students often struggle with correctly identifying the authors. This is because conference papers may list multiple contributors, including authors, editors, or contributors in various roles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The AAAI Conference proceedings typically list several authors, and distinguishing primary authors from other contributors can be challenging. Moreover, these papers are often part of a larger collection, which may list editors prominently, leading to confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the specific paper in the AAAI digital library or conference proceedings.<br />
2. Identify the section that lists the authors. This is usually at the beginning of the paper.<br />
3. Ensure you differentiate between authors and editors. Authors are those who conducted the research and wrote the paper, while editors compile the conference proceedings.<br />
4. List all authors in the order they appear, following APA guidelines for multiple authors.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Brown, C. (Eds.).<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Brown, C.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often misuse date formats when citing conference papers, using the date of access or publication of the proceedings instead of the actual conference year.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AAAI conferences are annual, but the publication of proceedings might occur in a different year, especially if the conference is held late in the year.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Verify the year of the conference by checking the title page or the header/footer of the paper.<br />
2. Use the year of the conference, not the year of publication of the proceedings, in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> (2022).<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023).</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Incorrectly formatting URLs for digital conference papers is a common issue. Students may omit necessary elements or include unnecessary ones.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AAAI papers are often accessed online, and students might copy and paste the URL from the browser bar without considering permalink structures or DOI inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. If a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is available, use it instead of a URL. Format it as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xxxxx).<br />
2. If no DOI is available, ensure you use a stable link or permalink provided by the AAAI digital library.<br />
3. Avoid using session-specific URLs from the browser bar.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI22/paper/view/12345<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i10.12345</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not realize that some AAAI conference papers require subscriptions or institutional access, leading to incorrect assumptions about accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AAAI may restrict access to certain papers, depending on institutional agreements and subscriptions, which can be confusing for students who assume all papers are freely accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if your institution provides access to the AAAI digital library through its library services.<br />
2. Use institutional login or interlibrary loan services if necessary.<br />
3. Ensure you are aware of access symbols or notices on the AAAI website to understand which papers are freely accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Assuming all papers are open-access.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Verifying access requirements through your institution's library portal.</p>
<p>By addressing these common challenges specific to the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, students can improve the accuracy and reliability of their citations, aligning them with APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
