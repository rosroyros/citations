<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Sociology of Health &amp; Illness-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the journal <em>Sociology of Health &amp; Illness</em> (SHI), students should be mindful of both the journal's specific format and the broader APA 7th edition style. One unique aspect of citing SHI is the inclusion of the article's DOI (Digital Object Identifier) whenever available, which is a standard requirement but crucial for ease of access to the journal's articles. The citation format for SHI generally follows APA guidelines, which dictate listing up to 20 authors by their last name and initials. If an article has more than 20 authors, APA 7th edition requires listing the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name.</p>
<p>A key difference when citing SHI, compared to more general citation practices, is ensuring that the publication's title is italicized and fully spelled out without abbreviations. Additionally, the volume number should be italicized, while the issue number should be enclosed in parentheses and not italicized. Students often confuse where to place punctuation marks, such as periods and commas, especially when transitioning between author names and publication details. Best practices include double-checking the DOI for accuracy and ensuring the correct use of italics and punctuation, which are common points of confusion.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should pay particular attention to the sequence and spacing of elements in the citation. For SHI, like other APA citations, the order is: Author(s). (Year). Title of the article. <em>Title of the Journal</em>, volume(issue), page range. https://doi.org/xx.xxxxxxxxx. It is advisable to use citation management tools or consult the journal's guidelines for the most accurate format, as these resources can help minimize errors and ensure compliance with both SHI-specific and APA guidelines.</p>
