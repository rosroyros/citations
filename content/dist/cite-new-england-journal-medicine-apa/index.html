<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>New England Journal of Medicine-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) follows the general principles of APA 7th edition guidelines but with particular nuances that students should be aware of. One significant aspect to note is the emphasis on including the DOI whenever available, as NEJM articles often have a DOI that ensures easy retrieval of the source. When citing an NEJM article, the format follows: Author(s). (Year). Title of the article. <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, volume(issue), page range. https://doi.org/xxxxx. This format is similar to other journal citations, yet the inclusion of the DOI is crucial due to the scientific and medical nature of the content, which often requires precise referencing for research purposes.</p>
<p>Where NEJM differs from standard citation rules is primarily in the handling of multiple authors. While APA generally requires listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, it is not uncommon for NEJM articles to have a large number of contributors, especially in collaborative medical research. In such cases, students should remember to list the first 19 authors’ last names and initials, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author’s name. This can be a point of confusion, especially when transitioning from the previous APA edition, which had different rules for the number of authors to list.</p>
<p>Common mistakes students make include incorrect formatting of the DOI or omitting it entirely, which hinders the accessibility of the source. To avoid this, always double-check the DOI format and ensure it is presented as a clickable hyperlink. Additionally, when dealing with multiple authors, pay careful attention to the order and the correct use of the ellipsis. Best practices include thoroughly reviewing NEJM articles for such details and using citation generators or management tools that are updated with the latest APA guidelines to minimize errors.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
- Use Journal Article format with New England Journal of Medicine specifics<br />
- Locate citation info on New England Journal of Medicine's website<br />
- Handle New England Journal of Medicine's unique formatting requirements</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-new-england-journal-of-medicine">Where to Find Citation Information on New England Journal of Medicine</h2>
<p>Navigating the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) website to locate citation information is straightforward, thanks to its user-friendly design tailored for academic and professional research. Here’s a detailed guide to help you efficiently find the necessary details for citing an article in APA 7th edition format.</p>
<h3 id="author-information">Author Information</h3>
<p>To locate the author of an article on the NEJM website, start by accessing the article of interest. Once you've opened the article, look towards the top of the page, directly below the article's title. The author byline is prominently displayed here, featuring the names of the contributing authors. In some cases, the byline may include affiliations, which can be helpful for assessing the authors' expertise and credentials.</p>
<h3 id="publication-date">Publication Date</h3>
<p>The publication date is another critical piece of information that can be easily found on the NEJM website. After identifying the article's title and author(s), look for the publication date directly beneath the author information. It is usually formatted as "Month Day, Year" (e.g., September 15, 2023), making it easy to spot and record accurately for citation purposes.</p>
<h3 id="article-title">Article Title</h3>
<p>The title of the article is prominently displayed at the top of the webpage, usually in a larger font size than the rest of the text. Ensure you capture the full title, including any subtitles, as it appears on the page. This precise attention to detail is crucial for an accurate citation.</p>
<h3 id="urlaccess-information">URL/Access Information</h3>
<p>To properly cite an electronic source, you need the URL, which is located in the browser’s address bar at the top of your screen. Highlight the entire URL and copy it to include in your reference list. NEJM articles are often locked behind a subscription or institutional access, so if you accessed the article through a library database or institutional login, note this access method as it may be relevant in your citation context.</p>
<h3 id="additional-unique-features">Additional Unique Features</h3>
<p>NEJM articles often have digital object identifiers (DOIs), which are a preferred element in APA citations. If a DOI is available, it is typically listed below the abstract or near the bottom of the article's page. Use this DOI in place of the URL when citing the article to ensure a more stable and reliable link to the source.</p>
<p>By following these specific steps on the NEJM website, you will efficiently gather all the required elements to create a complete and accurate APA 7th edition citation, facilitating academic integrity and the credibility of your research.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-new-england-journal-of-medicine">Common Issues When Citing New England Journal of Medicine</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-finding-authors">Problem 1: Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to accurately identify and list the authors of articles from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). This is primarily due to the journal’s practice of publishing articles with numerous contributors, sometimes including both individual authors and group authors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM frequently features articles with extensive research teams. The articles may also list a consortium or group as the author, which can confuse students trying to differentiate between individual and group authorship.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author Section:</strong> At the beginning of each article, NEJM typically lists the authors just below the title. Pay attention to any footnotes or asterisks that may indicate a group author.<br />
2. <strong>Check the End of the Article:</strong> Group authors may be detailed at the end in the "Author Affiliations" section, which can clarify who contributed as a group.<br />
3. <strong>Follow APA 7th Edition Guidelines:</strong> List up to 20 authors in the reference list. If more than 20, list the first 19, add an ellipsis, and then the final author’s name.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Incorrectly listing a group as an individual author.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Listing the group as the author, e.g., "Smith, J., Johnson, L., &amp; The Cardiovascular Study Group."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes get confused about how to format the publication date correctly when citing NEJM articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM articles often display a publication date that includes the month and day, which can differ from other journals that only provide the year.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Correct Date:</strong> The date is usually located near the article title or at the end of the article, near the DOI.<br />
2. <strong>Format According to APA:</strong> Use the year, followed by the month and day if available.<br />
3. <strong>Double-Check:</strong> Ensure that the date matches the one listed on NEJM's website or in the article's header/footer.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> (2023).<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023, September 15).</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Many students are unsure how to properly include and format URLs for NEJM articles in their references.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM articles often have multiple access points, including DOI links, publisher pages, and library databases, leading to confusion about which URL to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the DOI if Available:</strong> APA 7th edition prioritizes the DOI over a URL. Look for the DOI at the end of the article or in the citation information.<br />
2. <strong>Format Correctly:</strong> Replace "doi:" with "https://doi.org/" followed by the DOI number.<br />
3. <strong>Use the Stable URL:</strong> If no DOI is available, use the stable URL provided by NEJM or your institution's library.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> http://nejm.org/article/123456<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa123456</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Accessing full-text articles from NEJM can be a barrier for some students, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM is a subscription-based journal, meaning that full-text access often requires institutional or personal login credentials, which can limit students' ability to cite accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Check Institutional Access:</strong> Use your university library's website to access NEJM through institutional subscriptions.<br />
2. <strong>Use Abstracts Wisely:</strong> If full access is unavailable, use the free abstract to gather basic citation information.<br />
3. <strong>Consider Alternate Sources:</strong> If access remains an issue, seek similar articles available in open-access journals for citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Citation missing due to lack of access.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Properly citing using institutional access or referencing similar, available sources. </p>
<p>By addressing these specific challenges, students can more accurately and confidently navigate the citation process for the New England Journal of Medicine in APA 7th edition format.</p>
