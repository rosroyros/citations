<h2 id="quick-reference-renewable-and-sustainable-energy-reviews-citations">Quick Reference: Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews" (RSER) in APA 7th edition follows general APA guidelines but requires attention to detail, especially when listing authors. According to APA 7th edition, when a work has up to 20 authors, all authors' names should be included in the reference list. For each author, list the surname followed by the initials, using an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name. This rule applies to RSER as well, but students often get confused about formatting multiple authors or mistakenly shorten the list because it seems excessive.</p>
<p>Where RSER often differs from standard citation rules is in the volume and issue number presentation, especially if the journal's format changes. Students should ensure they accurately identify and include the volume number in italics followed by the issue number in parentheses, if available. The article's DOI should also be included at the end of the citation, formatted as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xxxx).</p>
<p>Common points of confusion include misordering authors, forgetting to italicize the journal title and volume number, and incorrect DOI formatting. Best practices for citing RSER involve double-checking that all author names are included and in the correct order, verifying the availability of a DOI, and reviewing the finished citation for consistent punctuation and italics. Students should also remain updated on any journal-specific changes that might affect citation format.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-renewable-and-sustainable-energy-reviews">Where to Find Citation Information on Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</h2>
<p>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews is a prominent journal that provides valuable insights into renewable and sustainable energy topics. When citing articles from this journal, it is crucial to locate accurate citation information. Below is a detailed guide to finding the essential details: author, publication date, title, and URL/access info.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Author(s):</strong><br />
   On the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews website, the author byline is typically located at the top of the article page. When you open an article, scroll down slightly past the article title, and you will usually find the list of authors. If the article has multiple authors, they will be listed in order. Be sure to note all authors as they appear because APA 7th edition requires listing up to 20 authors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong><br />
   The publication date can be found directly beneath the article title or the list of authors. It is important to capture the full date if available, including the day, month, and year. Some articles might only display the month and year of publication, which is acceptable for citation purposes if the day is not listed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Article Title:</strong><br />
   The title of the article appears prominently at the top of the article page. Ensure that you record the title exactly as it appears, including any subtitles. In APA 7th edition, capitalize only the first word of the title and any proper nouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL/Access Information:</strong><br />
   The URL is found in the browser's address bar at the top of your web browser. This is the direct link to the article and should be copied exactly as it appears. In APA 7th edition, you do not need to include a retrieval date unless the content is designed to change over time, such as a wiki page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Features:</strong><br />
   Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews articles often include a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is a unique identifier for electronic documents. If available, use the DOI in your citation, formatted as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/...). The DOI is often located near the top of the article page, usually above or below the article title or authors. Using a DOI is preferable in APA citations if it is available because it provides a permanent link to the content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps and considering the unique layout of the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews site, you can accurately cite articles in your academic work. Always ensure that you format your citations according to the APA 7th edition guidelines, paying attention to details like capitalization and punctuation.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-renewable-and-sustainable-energy-reviews">Common Issues When Citing Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors-correctly">Problem 1: Identifying Authors Correctly</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct authors when citing articles from "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews" (RSER). This confusion arises due to the presence of multiple contributors and the diverse author affiliations often listed.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
RSER frequently publishes articles with numerous authors, sometimes more than ten, reflecting the collaborative nature of research in renewable energy. The varied presentation of author names and affiliations can further complicate identification.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author List:</strong> Start by accessing the article's first page, where authors are usually listed prominently.<br />
2. <strong>Identify All Authors:</strong> Note all listed authors in the order they appear. If more than 20 authors are present, list the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis, then the last author's name.<br />
3. <strong>Check the Format:</strong> Ensure names are formatted as Last name, Initial(s). For instance, "Smith, J. K."<br />
4. <strong>Verify Affiliations Separately:</strong> While affiliations provide context, they are not needed in the citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<em>Before:</em> "John Smith, Jane Doe, etc."<br />
<em>After:</em> "Smith, J. K., Doe, J., ... [Last Author]."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-formatting-date-correctly">Problem 2: Formatting Date Correctly</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Formatting the publication date correctly poses a challenge, especially when multiple dates (e.g., online publication vs. issue publication) are involved.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles in RSER may first appear online before being assigned an issue date, leading to confusion about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Publication Date:</strong> Use the official publication date, often found at the top or bottom of the article's first page.<br />
2. <strong>Check for Online First:</strong> If the article is ahead of print, use the year of the first online appearance.<br />
3. <strong>Format Consistently:</strong> In APA, use the format "Year, Month Day," if available. Otherwise, use just the year.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<em>Before:</em> "Published: 2023/09/01"<br />
<em>After:</em> "2023."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls-correctly">Problem 3: Handling URLs Correctly</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often mishandle URLs, especially when articles are accessed through different databases or have complex DOI strings.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
RSER articles are frequently accessed via institutional access or various academic databases, each presenting URLs differently.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the DOI:</strong> If available, always prefer the DOI over URLs. Format it as "https://doi.org/XX.XXXXX".<br />
2. <strong>Check the Source:</strong> If using a URL, ensure it is stable and directly leads to the article.<br />
3. <strong>Avoid Database URLs:</strong> Do not use URLs specific to libraries or personal accounts, as they are inaccessible to others.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<em>Before:</em> "https://universitylibrary.com/article/123456"<br />
<em>After:</em> "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.123456"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-and-retrieval-dates">Problem 4: Access and Retrieval Dates</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Confusion arises over when to include retrieval dates, particularly for materials that may change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
RSER is a stable academic journal, so the need for retrieval dates is minimal. However, students may mistakenly include them, especially if accessing through varied platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Understand APA Guidelines:</strong> Retrieval dates are not needed for stable sources like journal articles unless the content is likely to change.<br />
2. <strong>Focus on Stability:</strong> Since RSER articles are permanent, omit retrieval dates.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
<em>Before:</em> "Retrieved on September 1, 2023, from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.123456"<br />
<em>After:</em> "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.123456"</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges, students can effectively and accurately cite articles from "Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews," ensuring adherence to APA 7th edition standards.</p>
