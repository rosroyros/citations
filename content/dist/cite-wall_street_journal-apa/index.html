<h2 id="quick-reference-the-wall-street-journal-citations">Quick Reference: The Wall Street Journal Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of article. <em>Name of Newspaper</em>. URL</p>
<p><strong>The Wall Street Journal-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing The Wall Street Journal in APA 7th edition requires special attention to its format and publication details. Unlike standard journal articles, The Wall Street Journal is a newspaper, which necessitates citing the full publication date, including the year, month, and day. The reference format for a print article looks like this: Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, p. Page number. For online articles, replace the page number with a URL: Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. URL.</p>
<p>Where The Wall Street Journal differs from standard citation rules is primarily in the use of the full date and the newspaper format. Unlike scholarly journals that typically require volume and issue numbers, newspapers like The Wall Street Journal rely on the specific date to direct readers to the correct article. This requirement can be a source of confusion for students accustomed to omitting the month and day in other citations.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should ensure they distinguish between print and online versions, accurately incorporating URLs when citing digital articles. Additionally, students should verify author names, as newspaper articles can sometimes list authors differently than academic journals. It's crucial to pay attention to the article's title and ensure it is italicized, along with the newspaper's name, to adhere to APA guidelines. These best practices will help ensure accurate and effective citations for The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-the-wall-street-journal">Where to Find Citation Information on The Wall Street Journal</h2>
<p>When conducting academic research and needing to cite articles from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), it's essential to know where to find the necessary citation details such as the author, publication date, title, and URL. Here's a detailed guide to help you navigate the WSJ website and locate these elements efficiently:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: On The Wall Street Journal website, identifying the author is straightforward. When you open an article, look for the author byline, which is typically situated just below the article's headline. The author’s name is usually hyperlinked, allowing you to click through for more details about their other works or biography. In cases where an article has multiple authors, each name will be listed in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date</strong>: The publication date is crucial for accurate citation and is prominently displayed beneath the article's headline, along with the author byline. It is formatted in the month-day-year style, such as "September 15, 2023." This information is essential to include as it indicates the timeliness and context of the article.</p>
</li>
<li>

Ensure you record the title exactly as it appears, including any punctuation, as this is crucial for a correct citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL/Access Information</strong>: The URL, or web address, is found in the browser's address bar at the top of your web browser. It is unique to the article and should be copied in full for your citation. The Wall Street Journal often uses a paywall, meaning full access to articles might require a subscription. If you accessed the article via a library database or alternative source, note this in your citation as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When citing the information from The Wall Street Journal in APA 7th edition, ensure you follow this format:</p>

<p>For instance:<br />
