<h2 id="quick-reference-energy-environmental-science-citations">Quick Reference: Energy &amp; Environmental Science Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Energy &amp; Environmental Science-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from the journal <em>Energy &amp; Environmental Science</em> can be unique due to the journal's specific formatting requirements, which may differ from general citation practices. While the APA 7th edition typically requires listing up to 20 authors using the last name followed by initials, <em>Energy &amp; Environmental Science</em> adheres to the citation style of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). This means that for this journal, the format does not typically list all authors for articles with many contributors; instead, it often uses "et al." after the first author when there are three or more authors. This is a significant deviation from APA's approach and can be a common point of confusion for students.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>Energy &amp; Environmental Science</em> citations may require additional details such as article code or unique identifiers that are not standard in APA format. Students often misunderstand the role of these identifiers, thinking they might be equivalent to DOIs, but they are specific to the journal's internal database. An actionable best practice is to always refer to the journal's guidelines for authors, which provide specific citation instructions, including how to properly abbreviate journal names and format article titles. Students should also utilize citation management tools that support the RSC style to avoid manual errors in formatting. By understanding these nuances, students can correctly cite <em>Energy &amp; Environmental Science</em> articles, ensuring both precision and adherence to the journal’s expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Include the DOI Link</strong><br />
<strong>Action:</strong> Finally, add the DOI link to the end of your citation. It should begin with "https://doi.org/". If there is no DOI, use the URL of the article instead.<br />
<strong>Verification:</strong> Ensure the DOI is correct and properly formatted. For example: https://doi.org/10.1039/d3ee00123g.<br />
<strong>Time Estimate:</strong> 5 minutes<br />
<strong>Tip for Efficiency:</strong> If you have access to the article online, look for the DOI usually located at the top or bottom of the article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compile the Citation</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-energy-environmental-science">Common Issues When Citing Energy &amp; Environmental Science</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly identifying the authors of articles from Energy &amp; Environmental Science, a peer-reviewed journal. This confusion arises because articles may have multiple authors, or the formatting on the journal's webpage may make it difficult to discern the order or full names of the authors.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
Energy &amp; Environmental Science often lists authors in a compact format, sometimes using initials for first names. Additionally, in some cases, author affiliations and footnotes can clutter the list, making it difficult for students to identify the primary authors versus contributors or editors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Article:</strong> Navigate to the article's landing page on the Energy &amp; Environmental Science website.<br />
2. <strong>Find the Author List:</strong> Scroll to the top or bottom of the article to find the author list. Usually, it is located near the article title.<br />
3. <strong>Expand Author Information:</strong> If the list appears truncated or uses initials, look for an option to expand the full list, such as a “More” button or hover feature.<br />
4. <strong>Correctly Format the Authors in APA:</strong> List authors in the order they appear. For APA 7th edition, use the format: Last Name, First Initial(s). For example, “Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, J.”</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Doe, J.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, J.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formatting">Problem 2: Date Formatting</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
Correctly formatting the publication date can be challenging, especially when articles are published online before being assigned to an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
Energy &amp; Environmental Science often publishes articles online ahead of print. Students may encounter confusion between the "online first" publication date and the formal issue publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Check the Publication Date:</strong> Identify whether the article is "online ahead of print" by checking the article's metadata usually located at the top or bottom of the article page.<br />
2. <strong>Use the Online Publication Date if No Issue is Assigned:</strong> If the article does not have an issue number, use the online publication date.<br />
3. <strong>Format the Date in APA Style:</strong> Use the year, followed by the month and day if available. For instance: (2023, August 15).</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023, August 15)</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
Students often face issues with the correct inclusion of URLs, especially when dealing with DOI links or subscription-based access.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
Energy &amp; Environmental Science articles often come with DOI links, which are preferred over URLs because they provide a permanent link to the content. However, students might mistakenly use the browser URL, which can be session-based and not persistent.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the DOI:</strong> Look for the DOI on the article page. It’s usually listed below the article title or in the citation information.<br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI in APA Style:</strong> Use the format: https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx.<br />
3. <strong>Do Not Use Session-Based URLs:</strong> Always replace any session URL with the DOI link.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> https://www.energy-environmentalscience.com/content/article1234567<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1039/D3EE12345A</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
Accessing full-text articles can be problematic for students without institutional access, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
Energy &amp; Environmental Science is often behind a paywall. Students may not have access to the entire article, leading to incomplete or inaccurate citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use Institutional Access:</strong> Check if your university provides access via library proxies.<br />
2. <strong>Use Open Access Links:</strong> Some articles are available as open access. Look for an “Open Access” label.<br />
3. <strong>Cite What You Can Access:</strong> If you cannot access the full text, you can still cite the abstract by noting it in the reference.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Full citation without access note.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Note access constraints: Smith, J. A. (2023). Title of the article. <em>Energy &amp; Environmental Science</em>. Abstract retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1039/D3EE12345A</p>
<p>By understanding and addressing these specific challenges, students can more accurately and effectively cite sources from Energy &amp; Environmental Science in their academic work.</p>
