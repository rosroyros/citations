<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Nano Energy-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from Nano Energy, like any specialized journal, requires adherence to specific formatting requirements that may differ from general citation rules. One key distinction is that Nano Energy adheres to the Elsevier referencing style, which typically follows the Vancouver style, a numbered citation format. In-text citations are presented numerically in the order they appear in the text, and the reference list is ordered numerically rather than alphabetically. This contrasts with APA's author-date citation style, where references are listed alphabetically by the author's last name and in-text citations include the author's last name and publication year.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion for students is handling multiple authors. In Vancouver style, up to six authors are listed in the reference list. If there are more than six authors, only the first six are listed, followed by 'et al.' This is different from APA 7th edition, which allows up to 20 authors to be listed in full before using 'et al.' for the 21st author and beyond. Best practices for citing Nano Energy include carefully matching the in-text citation numbers with the reference list and ensuring all necessary publication details, such as volume and page numbers, are included. Students should also verify whether their institution requires adherence to Nano Energy or APA standards, as requirements may vary. To avoid mistakes, students should consult the specific submission guidelines provided by Nano Energy or use citation management tools that support multiple citation styles.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
