<p><strong>The New England Journal of Medicine-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in APA 7th edition format has some unique considerations, particularly due to the potential large number of authors and the journal's prominence in medical literature. For articles with up to 20 authors, APA guidelines require listing all authors by their last names followed by initials, separated by commas, with an ampersand before the last author's name. This is consistent with general APA rules and applies to NEJM articles as well. However, for articles with more than 20 authors, APA 7th edition specifies listing the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis (…), and then the final author's name without using an ampersand.</p>
<p>A unique aspect of NEJM articles is their frequent use of DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers), which should always be included in citations when available. The correct format involves placing the DOI at the end of the reference, prefixed by "https://doi.org/". Where NEJM articles may differ from standard citation rules is in the frequent updates and online-first publications, making it essential to check for the most recent version and accurate publication details.</p>
<p>Students commonly confuse the order and formatting of author names, especially when dealing with numerous authors, as well as where to place the DOI in the citation. A best practice is to always verify the author list directly from the journal's website or the article PDF to avoid transcription errors. Additionally, using citation management tools can help ensure accuracy, but students should double-check the formatting against APA guidelines, particularly for NEJM articles due to their complex authorship. This diligence helps maintain the integrity of academic work and ensures proper acknowledgment of sources.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-the-new-england-journal-of-medicine">Where to Find Citation Information on The New England Journal of Medicine</h2>
<p>The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) is a premier medical journal that offers a wealth of information for academic research. To accurately cite an article from NEJM, it's crucial to locate key citation elements such as the author, publication date, title, and URL. Here’s a detailed guide to navigating the NEJM website to find these elements:</p>
<p><strong>Accessing the Article:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Search for the Article</strong>: Begin by accessing the NEJM website directly through a web search or by entering the URL (https://www.nejm.org) in your browser. Use the search bar on the NEJM homepage to find the specific article you need by entering relevant keywords or the article title.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Locating Citation Information:</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Author Byline</strong>: Once you have accessed the specific article page, look for the author byline. This is typically located directly below the article title. Authors are usually listed in a straightforward format, and clicking on an author’s name may provide additional credentials or affiliations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date</strong>: The publication date is generally found beneath the author names or at the top of the article, directly below the title. It is often displayed in a month, day, and year format, which is crucial for creating an accurate citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Article Title</strong>: The title of the article is prominently displayed at the top of the page. Ensure you capture the full title as it appears, including any subtitles, as this is an essential component of your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract and Full Text</strong>: For additional context or detailed information, you can read the abstract or access the full text if available. This can sometimes provide further citation information, especially when multiple authors or complex titles are involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL/Access Information</strong>: The URL of the article is found in the browser’s address bar. Copy the complete URL as it appears to ensure that your citation directs readers to the exact article. Remember that NEJM articles have a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) that is often listed at the end of the article or in the citation tools provided by the website. Including the DOI in your citation is highly recommended as it provides a permanent link to the digital content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Unique Features of NEJM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Citation Tools</strong>: NEJM often provides a "Cite" function or similar tools near the article title or within the sidebar. This feature can automatically generate citations in various formats, including APA. Utilizing these tools can save time and ensure accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription Access</strong>: Note that some articles may require a subscription to view the full text. However, abstracts and basic citation information are generally accessible without a subscription.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently gather all necessary citation information from NEJM, ensuring your references are accurate and complete according to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-the-new-england-journal-of-medicine">Common Issues When Citing The New England Journal of Medicine</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to identify the correct list of authors when citing articles from The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). This confusion arises because NEJM articles frequently have multiple authors, and students may not know how to list them all or how to correctly format the author list in APA style.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM is a prestigious medical journal, and its articles often involve large teams of researchers, leading to long author lists. Additionally, NEJM uses a specific layout that may not clearly distinguish between the primary author and others, which can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author Information:</strong> On the NEJM article page, authors are typically listed at the top of the article. If there are many authors, a link may be provided that expands to show the full list.<br />
2. <strong>Follow APA Guidelines for Multiple Authors:</strong> <br />
   - For up to 20 authors, list them all in your citation.<br />
   - For 21 or more authors, list the first 19, insert an ellipsis (…), and then add the final author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., Johnson, A., &amp; Others, E. (2023).</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., Johnson, A., Brown, B., Williams, C., Jones, D., Garcia, E., Miller, F., Davis, G., Rodriguez, H., Martinez, I., Hernandez, J., Lopez, K., Gonzalez, L., Wilson, M., Anderson, N., Thomas, O., Taylor, P., Moore, Q., &amp; Jackson, R. (2023).</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may incorrectly format the date of publication, especially when only a month or year is available, or when they misinterpret the date format on the website.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM publishes articles frequently, and sometimes only the year is prominently displayed. However, the actual publication date can often be found in a smaller font or in a different section.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Correct Date:</strong> Check the article page carefully for the most complete version of the publication date. This is usually found near the article title or in the article information section.<br />
2. <strong>Apply APA Date Formats:</strong> Use the format "Year, Month Day" if the full date is available. If not, use "Year, Month" or simply "Year."</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
(2023.)</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
(2023, October 15.)</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may struggle with how to correctly include URLs in their citations, especially when NEJM articles are accessed through institutional libraries or databases that use proxy URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM articles often require subscription access, which means that students may encounter different URLs depending on their access method. Proxy URLs can complicate the citation process.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the Stable URL:</strong> NEJM provides a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for each article, which should be used instead of a URL. <br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI Correctly:</strong> In APA format, present the DOI as a clickable link, starting with "https://doi.org/".</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved from: http://proxy.yourschool.edu/nejm/article/123456</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1234567</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not realize that NEJM requires a subscription for full access, affecting how they cite the source if they only have abstract access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
NEJM's articles are behind a paywall, and without institutional access, students might only see abstracts. They may mistakenly cite the entire article without having full access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Verify Access Level:</strong> Ensure that you have full access to the article. If you only have access to the abstract, make this clear in your citation.<br />
2. <strong>Indicate Abstract Use When Applicable:</strong> If only the abstract is used, note this in your reference list.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
The New England Journal of Medicine, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Author(s). (Year). Title of the article. <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1234567 (Abstract)</p>
