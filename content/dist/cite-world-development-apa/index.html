<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>World Development-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "World Development" follows the general APA 7th edition guidelines for journals but with particular attention to details that can trip up students. As with any academic journal, you must include the author(s), publication year, article title, journal name, volume number, issue number, and page range. What makes citing "World Development" unique is the attention to detail required in capturing the exact volume and issue numbers, as this journal is highly regarded and frequently referenced, necessitating precise citations to ensure proper credit and retrievability.</p>
<p>Unlike some sources where listing all authors might become cumbersome, "World Development" articles can have a significant number of contributors. APA 7th edition allows you to list up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, followed by the final author’s name. This guideline differs from previous versions where only the first seven authors were listed. Students often confuse the sequence and punctuation when dealing with multiple authors, especially in distinguishing between the use of commas and ampersands. </p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, carefully double-check the spelling of each author’s name and the order in which they're listed. Ensure that journal names are italicized and that the volume number is also in italics but not the issue number or page range. A best practice is to always cross-reference the citation with the journal’s official website or database entry to confirm accuracy, especially since details like DOI numbers are critical in academic citations. By adhering to these specific guidelines, students can ensure their citations are both accurate and professional.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />

<h2 id="common-citation-problems-in-citing-world-development">Common Citation Problems in Citing "World Development"</h2>
<p>Citing articles from "World Development" can present unique challenges due to its specific publication format and the interface used to access its content. Here, we address common issues students face, providing practical solutions to ensure accurate APA 7th edition citations.</p>
<h3 id="1-identifying-authors">1. Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Students often struggle to identify the correct authors of articles from "World Development," especially when dealing with collaborative research papers that include numerous contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
"World Development" frequently features articles authored by multiple researchers, sometimes listing contributors by their roles or affiliations rather than clearly delineating each author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the article directly through a library database or the journal's official website.<br />
- <strong>Step 2</strong>: Look for a section explicitly labeled "Authors" or check the article's header or footer for author names.<br />
- <strong>Step 3</strong>: Ensure you list all authors in the order they appear, using the format: Last Name, First Initial. Second Initial. (e.g., Smith, J. A.).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: Smith, J., et al.<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: Smith, J. A., Brown, L. M., &amp; Taylor, R. S.</p>
<h3 id="2-date-formats">2. Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Incorrectly formatting the publication date is a common error, often due to confusion between the online publication date and the print issue date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
Articles in "World Development" may be available online before being assigned to a print issue, leading to multiple dates being associated with a single article.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Step 1</strong>: Use the date the article was published online if the print issue is not yet available. Otherwise, use the issue date.<br />
- <strong>Step 2</strong>: Format the date as (Year, Month Day) if available, or simply (Year) if only the year is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: (2023-07-15)<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: (2023, July 15)</p>
<h3 id="3-handling-urls">3. Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Students often incorrectly format URLs or omit them entirely when citing online articles.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
"World Development" articles may be accessed through various platforms, leading to confusion about which URL to use or how to format it.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Step 1</strong>: Use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available, as it provides a permanent link to the article.<br />
- <strong>Step 2</strong>: If a DOI is not available, use the URL where the article was retrieved, ensuring it is a direct link to the content.<br />
- <strong>Step 3</strong>: Always format the URL or DOI as a hyperlink.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: Retrieved from www.journalwebsite.com<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.105123</p>
<h3 id="4-access-requirements">4. Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>:<br />
Students may not have access or may be unsure how to cite articles behind paywalls.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>:<br />
"World Development" is a subscription-based journal, and some articles may only be accessible through institutional access or purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the article through your institution's library portal or a database that provides access.<br />
- <strong>Step 2</strong>: If you accessed the article through a library database, note that access date is not required in APA 7th edition.<br />
- <strong>Step 3</strong>: Ensure the citation reflects the source's version you accessed, using the DOI or a stable URL.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Before</strong>: Retrieved from library database<br />
- <strong>After</strong>: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.105123</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-world-development">Frequently Asked Questions About World Development</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How do I find the necessary citation information for a World Development article on their website?</strong></p>
<p>A: To find citation information on the World Development website, locate the article you are interested in and look for the "Cite" or "Citation Information" section, usually found near the article title or abstract. This section will typically provide the authors' names, publication date, article title, journal name, volume, issue number, and page range.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I cite a World Development article if it lists multiple authors in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: In APA format, list the authors in the same order as they appear in the article. If there are up to 20 authors, list each one separated by commas, with an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name. For more than 20 authors, list the first 19, insert an ellipsis, and then add the final author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I cite a World Development article if it has a non-standard publication date format?</strong></p>
<p>A: World Development articles typically follow a standard date format, but if you encounter a unique format, use the year of publication, as this is most crucial for APA citations. If the month and day are available and relevant, include them after the year in parentheses (e.g., 2023, March 15).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the URL and access date requirements when citing a World Development article in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: For World Development articles accessed online, include a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available. If a DOI is not available, use the URL of the journal's homepage. Access dates are not required in APA 7th edition unless the content is likely to change, which is uncommon for journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing a World Development article differ from other journal articles in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: Citing a World Development article in APA format is generally the same as citing any other journal article. The main difference is ensuring you have the correct journal-specific details, such as the accurate journal title, volume, issue number, and DOI, which can affect the citation's completeness and accuracy.</p>
