<p><strong>European Conference on Computer Vision-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing papers from the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in APA 7th edition, there are particular elements to highlight that may differ from standard source type citations. Typically, conference proceedings are treated as book chapters, which means you need to include both the paper's authors and the editors of the conference proceedings. The format is: Author(s). (Year). Title of paper. In Editor(s) (Ed(s).), <em>Title of Proceedings</em> (pp. page numbers). Publisher. DOI or URL. This format emphasizes the dual nature of conference papers, which are both authored works and part of an edited collection.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises from differentiating between the paper's authors and the editors of the proceedings, as well as correctly formatting the conference title and location if provided. Unlike journal articles, where only the article title and journal name are italicized, in conference proceedings, the title of the proceedings is italicized, and the paper title is not. Additionally, students often overlook including the page numbers of the paper within the proceedings, a crucial element that helps locate the paper.</p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, students should always verify whether the ECCV proceedings are published as a book or a journal series, as this can slightly affect the citation format. Checking the publisher's guidelines or the front matter of the proceedings can provide clarity. Another best practice is to consistently look for a DOI, as it provides a stable link to the paper, enhancing the citation's reliability. Using citation management tools carefully and cross-referencing with official APA guidelines can further minimize errors.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
- Use Conference Paper format with European Conference on Computer Vision specifics<br />
- Locate citation info on European Conference on Computer Vision's website<br />
- Handle European Conference on Computer Vision's unique formatting requirements</p>

<p>To effectively find citation information on the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) using Google Scholar, follow these detailed steps to locate the necessary elements for citation, such as the author, publication date, title, and URL/access information. This guide assumes you are accessing the ECCV proceedings or related papers via Google Scholar.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing Google Scholar:</strong><br />
   Begin by navigating to Google Scholar's main page. In the search bar, type "European Conference on Computer Vision" followed by any specific year or topic you are interested in. This will help narrow down the results to relevant papers from the ECCV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locating the Title:</strong><br />
   Once your search results load, each entry will display the paper's title prominently in blue text. The title is a clickable link that will take you to more detailed information about the paper. Ensure you note down the exact title, as it appears here for accurate citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying the Author(s):</strong><br />
   Directly below the title, you will find the author byline. This line lists the authors in the order they appear on the paper, typically separated by commas. If there are multiple authors, ensure you capture all names as listed, because this is critical for your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding the Publication Date:</strong><br />
   The publication date is usually listed immediately following the author names, often in a format such as "2022" or "2022, ECCV Proceedings." This information might be part of a bracketed description or simply noted separately, ensuring that you can easily identify the year of publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Information/URL:</strong><br />
   Google Scholar entries often include a [PDF] or [HTML] link on the right side of the entry, which directs you to the full paper. If you click on the title, you may also be taken directly to the publisher's website or a university archive. The URL in the browser's address bar after clicking through to the full text is what you will use for your citation. If you access the paper through a PDF link, ensure that you capture the URL of the page where you accessed the PDF, not just the PDF file itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Tips:</strong><br />
   For further details, if the paper redirects you to a publisher's site, check for institutional access or free versions. Some papers might be behind paywalls, but Google Scholar often identifies versions available in open-access repositories, indicated by links like [PDF] from academic institutions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently extract all necessary citation details from ECCV papers on Google Scholar, ensuring your citations are complete and accurate as per APA or any required format.</p>
