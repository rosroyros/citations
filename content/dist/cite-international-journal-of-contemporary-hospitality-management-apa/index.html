<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management in APA 7th edition, students should adhere to the standard guidelines for journal articles but must be aware of a few specific considerations that might apply to this journal. In general, APA format requires the author's last name followed by initials, the publication year in parentheses, the title of the article in sentence case, the journal name in title case and italics, the volume number in italics, the issue number in parentheses (if applicable), and the page range. For example: Smith, J. A. (2023). Title of the article. <em>International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 35</em>(4), 123-145.</p>
<p>A unique aspect of citing from the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management is ensuring the DOI, if available, is included at the end of the citation. In APA 7th edition, the DOI should be formatted as a URL: https://doi.org/xxxx. Unlike some journals that might have unique citation formats, this journal follows the standard APA rules, but students often overlook details such as the inclusion of all co-authors up to 20, before using an ellipsis for more than 20 authors. Each author's last name should be followed by their initials without any space in between, separated by commas.</p>
<p>Students often misunderstand the number of authors to list before using an ellipsis, which is particularly relevant when citing articles from journals with large collaborative authorship. Remember to list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name if there are more than 20 authors. To avoid errors, always verify the most current guidelines on the journal’s website or the APA manual. Ensure accuracy by double-checking details like spelling, proper punctuation, and DOI formatting to maintain the credibility and professionalism of the citation.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-international-journal-of-contemporary-hospitality-management">Where to Find Citation Information on International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management</h2>
<p>To accurately cite articles from the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management (IJCHM), students need to navigate the journal's website effectively to gather specific citation information such as the author, publication date, article title, and URL/access information. Here is a detailed guide on how to locate each piece of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Author Information</strong>: Once on the article's page within the IJCHM site, the author byline is typically located immediately below the article title. This section lists all contributing authors, usually in a clear, bold font to ensure easy visibility. For articles with multiple authors, they are usually separated by commas, and you should list them in the order they appear for citation purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date</strong>: The publication date is generally found beneath the author names or near the top of the page, close to the journal’s issue number or volume information. On the IJCHM's platform, this information might be presented in a format such as "Published: Month Day, Year" or simply "Publication date: Month Year."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Article Title</strong>: The title of the article is prominently displayed at the top of the article page. It is typically in a larger font size compared to the rest of the text and centered for emphasis. Make sure to note the exact wording and punctuation of the title, as it should be replicated exactly in your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL/Access Information</strong>: The URL, which is the direct link to the article, can be found in your browser’s address bar once you have navigated to the specific article page. It's essential to ensure you are on the correct page for the specific article you intend to cite, as each article has a unique URL. Copy the entire link for accurate citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Access Information</strong>: Sometimes, additional access details such as DOI (Digital Object Identifier) are provided, usually near the abstract or at the bottom of the page. This unique identifier is crucial for APA citations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, when navigating the IJCHM website, focus on these specific locations: look for the authors under the article title, find the publication date under the author names, note the exact article title at the top, and copy the URL from the address bar. The structured layout of the IJCHM site is designed to facilitate easy access to these key details, streamlining the citation process for students and researchers.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-international-journal-of-contemporary-hospitality-management">Common Issues When Citing International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify authors when citing articles from the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management. This can lead to incorrect citations in their academic work.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The confusion often arises because the journal sometimes features articles with multiple authors, including corporate authors or collaborations between academia and industry. Additionally, author names might be listed in various formats, such as initials only or first and last names, which can be inconsistent across articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author Section:</strong> On the journal's webpage for the specific article, look for the section usually placed at the top or bottom of the article, where author names are listed.<br />
2. <strong>Check the Full Text:</strong> If the webpage is ambiguous, download the full article PDF, which often clearly lists all authors, including their full names and affiliations.<br />
3. <strong>Use Author Order:</strong> Follow the order in which authors are presented. In APA, you should list authors in the same order as they appear in the publication.<br />
4. <strong>Verify with ORCID or Author Profiles:</strong> If available, use ORCID IDs or institutional profiles linked in the article to confirm authors' full names.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J. (2023).</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Smith, John, &amp; Doe, Jane. (2023).</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Correctly formatting the publication date can be challenging, particularly when articles are published online first or have multiple publication dates.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management may have an "Online First" date and an official publication date. Students often confuse these dates, using the incorrect one in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Correct Date:</strong> Use the publication date that corresponds to the version of the article you accessed. For articles with both "Online First" and final publication dates, prefer the latter if available.<br />
2. <strong>Check the PDF:</strong> The official publication date is often noted in the header or footer of the PDF version.<br />
3. <strong>Use APA Format:</strong> Format the date as (Year, Month Day) only if the month and day are available; otherwise, use just the year.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
(Online First: 2023)</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
(2023)</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Including the correct URL in citations can be tricky due to the journal's use of DOI and accessibility through institutional databases.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Students may link directly to the journal's homepage or use URLs from database access points, which are often session-specific and not persistent.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOI:</strong> Always prefer the DOI over a URL if available. It provides a permanent link to the content.<br />
2. <strong>Retrieve DOI:</strong> Locate the DOI on the article's webpage or within the article PDF itself.<br />
3. <strong>Format Correctly:</strong> In APA, format the DOI as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx).</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
https://www.emerald.com/insight/journal/ijchm</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may have difficulty accessing articles, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management is often accessed through institutional subscriptions or databases requiring specific login credentials.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Confirm Access:</strong> Ensure you have access through your academic institution or library. Use institutional logins where required.<br />
2. <strong>Use Library Resources:</strong> Use your library's database portal to access full texts, ensuring you have all the necessary citation information.<br />
3. <strong>Request if Unavailable:</strong> If you cannot access an article, request it through interlibrary loans or speak to a librarian.</p>
<p>By addressing these challenges specific to the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, students can create accurate and reliable citations in their academic writing.</p>
