<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>American Educational Research Journal-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from the <em>American Educational Research Journal (AERJ)</em> follows the general principles of APA 7th edition, but there are specific nuances that are important to note. Firstly, like other APA-style journals, AERJ requires that you list up to 20 authors in the order they appear, using the authors' last names followed by their initials. This is consistent with APA 7th edition guidelines, which was an update from the 6th edition that only allowed for up to seven authors to be listed before using an ellipsis. Therefore, when citing an AERJ article with multiple authors, ensure you list all authors up to 20 before using an ellipsis if there are more.</p>
<p>A point of differentiation for AERJ is ensuring accuracy in the journal's title and the use of italics. Students often confuse the journal's name or fail to italicize it properly. The full title should be italicized in the citation: <em>American Educational Research Journal</em>. Additionally, students should pay attention to the specific volume and issue number formatting, which is a common area of confusion. The volume number should be italicized, followed by the issue number in parentheses, not italicized, e.g., <em>American Educational Research Journal, 52</em>(3).</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should double-check the source's DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and ensure it is formatted correctly as a URL: https://doi.org/xxxx. Consistency in punctuation, such as using commas and periods correctly, is crucial as well. Always cross-reference your citation against the most current APA guidelines to ensure compliance. Keeping a checklist of these specific requirements when citing AERJ articles can aid in avoiding errors and maintaining accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-american-educational-research-journal">Where to Find Citation Information on American Educational Research Journal</h2>
<p>Navigating the American Educational Research Journal's (AERJ) website to find citation information is a straightforward process, thanks to its user-friendly layout. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you efficiently locate the necessary details for crafting a proper citation in APA 7th edition format:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding the Author(s):</strong><br />
   - Once you have accessed an article on the AERJ website, the author byline is prominently displayed at the top of the article page. Immediately below the article title, you will find the names of the authors listed. This information is crucial as it provides the foundation for your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locating the Publication Date:</strong><br />
   - Directly beneath the author byline, you will see the publication date. It is typically formatted in a day-month-year sequence, such as "Published: March 15, 2023." This date is essential for your citation to indicate when the research was formally published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying the Article Title:</strong><br />
   - The article title is prominently displayed at the very top of the page, often in bold typeface. This is one of the most visible elements on the page and serves as the primary descriptor of the content you are citing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the URL:</strong><br />
   - The URL is found in the browser’s address bar at the top of your web browser. It provides the direct link to the article and is necessary for your citation to allow others to access the source. Ensure you copy the entire URL, as it is specific to the article you are referencing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Access Information:</strong><br />
   - At the bottom of the article page, you may find additional access details such as DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is a unique identifier for the article. The DOI is often preferred in academic citations as it provides a persistent link to the content. Look for a section labeled "Article Information" or similar at the bottom of the page for this detail.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The AERJ website’s consistency in layout across articles makes it easier for students to locate these components quickly. By following these steps, you will have all the information needed to construct a complete APA 7th edition reference. For instance, your reference might look like this:</p>
<p>Author(s). (Year, Month Day). Title of the article. <em>American Educational Research Journal</em>. URL</p>
<p>Remember, the key to effective citation is attention to detail and consistency in format, which this guide aims to ensure.</p>

<p><strong>Action</strong>: Look at the article you want to cite. Identify the authors' names and their initials.</p>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure you list all authors in the correct format: Last name, First initial. For example, if the authors are John Smith and Jane Doe, you will write them as Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J.</p>
<p><strong>Time Estimate</strong>: 5 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If there are multiple authors, remember to use an ampersand (&amp;) before the last author's name.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-american-educational-research-journal">Common Issues When Citing American Educational Research Journal</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often encounter difficulties in identifying the correct authors to cite from the American Educational Research Journal (AERJ), especially when dealing with articles that have multiple contributors or editorial pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AERJ, like many academic journals, frequently publishes articles authored by multiple researchers. Additionally, certain sections might be attributed to editorial teams rather than individual authors, leading to confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Article:</strong> Start by accessing the full-text version of the article through your institution's library or the AERJ website.<br />
2. <strong>Identify the Authors:</strong> Look at the article's title page or the first page where authors are typically listed. Ensure each name is spelled correctly and in the order presented.<br />
3. <strong>Check for Editorials or Special Sections:</strong> If the piece is an editorial or a special section, it may be attributed to an editorial board rather than individual authors. In this case, use the name of the editorial board as the author.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Before: "Smith, J., &amp; Doe, J. (Ed.)."<br />
- After: "American Educational Research Journal Editorial Board."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-formatting-the-date">Problem 2: Formatting the Date</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Citing the correct date format can be tricky, especially if students are unsure whether to include the month and day or just the year.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AERJ typically provides publication information in a format that may not be immediately clear, especially if students are accessing articles from databases that list multiple publishing dates (e.g., online first vs. print).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the Year of Publication:</strong> For journal articles, only the year of publication is required in APA format.<br />
2. <strong>Check the First Page or Citation Information:</strong> The publication year is often listed on the first page or in the citation information provided by AERJ.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Before: "(2023, April 15)."<br />
- After: "(2023)."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling-for-online-articles">Problem 3: URL Handling for Online Articles</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students are often unsure how to handle URLs for articles accessed online, especially when there are multiple links provided by the journal or library databases.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
AERJ articles may be accessible through various platforms, and students might find different URL formats (DOI, persistent links, etc.), leading to confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOIs When Available:</strong> APA format prioritizes the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) over URLs.<br />
2. <strong>Access the DOI:</strong> Look for the DOI on the article's first page or citation information.<br />
3. <strong>Use the URL if DOI is Unavailable:</strong> If a DOI is not available, use a direct URL that leads to the article's landing page rather than the library database page.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Before: "Retrieved from https://library.database.com/article?id=12345"<br />
- After: "https://doi.org/10.3102/00028312231123456"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements-and-paywalls">Problem 4: Access Requirements and Paywalls</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may struggle with citing articles that are behind paywalls or require institutional access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Many AERJ articles are accessible only through institutional subscriptions or purchase, which can complicate the citation process if students are unsure how to denote restricted access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Cite as Usual:</strong> Even if the article is behind a paywall, the citation format remains the same. Do not include access information like “Retrieved from” if using a DOI.<br />
2. <strong>Indicate Access Date Only if Necessary:</strong> Only include a retrieval date if the content is likely to change over time (which is not common for journal articles).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- Before: "Retrieved on October 10, 2023, from https://journals.sagepub.com/home/aerj"<br />
- After: "https://doi.org/10.3102/00028312231123456"</p>
<p>By understanding these common citation challenges specific to AERJ and using APA 7th edition guidelines effectively, students can ensure their citations are accurate and consistent.</p>
