<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, a journal following the American Chemical Society (ACS) style guidelines, there are specific formatting requirements that differ from generic citation systems such as APA or MLA. One key aspect is the way multiple authors are listed. For articles with up to 20 authors, ACS requires listing all authors using their last names followed by initials without spaces or punctuation between initials. Unlike APA's rule for summarizing authors with "et al." after 20 authors, ACS mandates listing all authors in the order they appear on the publication. </p>
<p>This specificity can differ from the standard citation rules, where APA, for instance, employs an “et al.” abbreviation after the first author for works with more than 20 authors. Additionally, ACS style requires the inclusion of the article title, journal abbreviation, publication year, volume number, and page range, formatted with specific punctuation and italics. The journal title is abbreviated and italicized, which is distinct from the full journal titles often required in other styles like APA.</p>
<p>Common points of confusion for students include the journal abbreviation, the lack of spaces between initials, and the distinctive use of italics and punctuation. Students may also overlook the need to list all authors for articles with up to 20 contributors, mistakenly applying "et al." prematurely. Best practices for citing ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces include double-checking the journal’s official abbreviation, ensuring all author names are listed in the correct order, and paying close attention to punctuation and italics as specified by ACS guidelines. Utilizing citation management tools or referencing the ACS Style Guide can streamline this process and help avoid common pitfalls.</p>

Look for a list of names, which may include hyperlinks to author profiles or their associated institutions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Identifying the Publication Date:</strong></p>
<p>The publication date is usually located beneath the author byline. In ACS journals, it is common to find this information near the top of the article page, often alongside the journal volume and issue number. This date indicates when the article was published online, which is crucial for citation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Title of the Article:</strong></p>
<p>The title of the article is prominently displayed at the top of the article's page. It is typically in a larger, bold font to distinguish it from other text. Ensure you use the full title as it appears on the page for accurate citation.</p>
<p><strong>5. URL/Access Information:</strong></p>
<p>The URL of the article is found in the browser’s address bar at the top of your web browser. It is crucial to copy this URL exactly as it appears for direct access to the article. Ensure you are on the article’s main page before copying the URL to avoid linking to a search results page.</p>
<p><strong>6. Additional Citation Elements:</strong></p>
<p>For ACS journals, you may also need other information such as the volume number, issue number, and page range. This information is typically located alongside the publication date and can be found near the top of the page, often under the article title or in the header of the article’s PDF version.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessing PDFs:</strong> If available, download the PDF version of the article for a neatly formatted reference that includes all citation information.</li>
<li><strong>Using Citation Tools:</strong> ACS publications often provide citation tools or export options that can format the citation for you in various styles, including APA.</li>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-acs-applied-materials-interfaces">Common Issues When Citing ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students often struggle with correctly identifying and listing authors when citing articles from ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. This challenge is particularly prevalent when dealing with articles that have numerous authors or when the authors are listed in a non-standard format.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, like many scientific journals, frequently publishes collaborative research with multiple authors. The journal often lists authors with their full names, affiliations, and corresponding author indications, which can be confusing when extracting names for citation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <br />
1. Navigate to the article on the ACS Publications website.<br />
2. Locate the author list, typically found at the top of the article page under the article title.<br />
3. Record each author’s name as presented, ensuring to preserve the order.<br />
4. For APA citation, list up to 20 authors. If there are more than 20, list the first 19 followed by an ellipsis, and then the last author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- Before: "J. Smith, B. Johnson, et al."<br />
- After: "Smith, J., Johnson, B., Wang, T., Chen, L., Patel, R., … and Brown, S."</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students might be confused about the correct date format to use when citing articles from ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, especially since the journal may display multiple dates (e.g., submission, acceptance, publication).</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: The journal often provides several dates related to the publication process, which can lead to confusion about which date to use in a citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <br />
1. Use the publication date of the article, which is often found on the article's first page or in the citation information section.<br />
2. In APA format, use the year of publication only for journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- Before: "2023, June 15"<br />
- After: "2023"</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students may not know how to properly include URLs in their citations, particularly when dealing with articles behind paywalls or when multiple URLs are provided.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces articles are often behind paywalls, and students may be unsure whether to include a direct URL or a DOI.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <br />
1. Always use a DOI if available, as it provides a stable and permanent link to the article.<br />
2. If a DOI is not available, use the URL of the article's landing page, but this is rare for ACS journals.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- Before: "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c12345"<br />
- After: "https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c12345"</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description</strong>: Students might not understand how to handle citations for articles that require a subscription or institutional access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens</strong>: Many articles from ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces are accessible only through institutional subscriptions, which can complicate access for individual students.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <br />
1. If you accessed the article through institutional access, cite it as you would any other journal article without indicating access restrictions.<br />
2. If discussing the source's access in your paper, mention any relevant access considerations (e.g., through university libraries).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:<br />
- Before: "Accessed via university library"<br />
- After: No change needed in the citation; just cite normally using DOI.</p>
<p>By understanding these common citation challenges specific to ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces and following these solutions, students can more accurately and confidently cite their sources according to APA guidelines.</p>
