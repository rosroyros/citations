<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Materials-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from <em>Advanced Materials</em> requires attention to certain unique details that can differ from standard APA citation rules, particularly in handling author lists. In general APA 7th edition guidelines, when citing a work with up to 20 authors, all authors must be listed by last name and initials, separated by commas. However, <em>Advanced Materials</em> follows a more streamlined approach. For articles published in this journal, the author's names are typically provided in a simplified format consistent with the journal's style, which students should follow closely when they are directly referencing these articles. </p>
<p>One of the key differences is the presentation of the journal title and the use of DOI numbers. <em>Advanced Materials</em> mandates the inclusion of DOIs for all articles, which is also a standard practice in APA, but students should be aware of the specific format: "doi:10.xxxx/xxxxxx." Unlike the italicized journal titles required in APA, <em>Advanced Materials</em> may have additional style preferences in its own publications that should be mirrored when citing their articles in APA format. To avoid confusion, students should consult the journal's guidelines and ensure they are cross-referencing with APA requirements.</p>
<p>Common points of confusion include whether to abbreviate the journal title (it should not be abbreviated in APA) and how to format complex author lists. Best practices involve double-checking the DOI format, ensuring the journal name is presented in full without abbreviations, and meticulously listing up to 20 authors as per APA rules when not directly following the journal's citation style. Students should also consistently refer to the APA manual alongside the <em>Advanced Materials</em> guidelines to ensure accuracy and compliance with both standards.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieving URL/Access Information</strong>:<br />
   To cite the article, you need the URL, which is located in the browser's address bar at the top of your web browser. Copy this URL as it will direct others to the exact location of the article online. If accessing through a database, ensure you use a stable or permanent link, often found in the article's citation tools or sharing options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Citation Details</strong>:<br />
   For complete citation accuracy, note the volume and issue number, which are often listed near the article title or in the article's metadata section. This information is crucial for APA citations.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-advanced-materials">Common Issues When Citing Advanced Materials</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct authors for articles published in <em>Advanced Materials</em>. This challenge arises because the journal sometimes lists multiple authors, and determining the order can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Advanced Materials</em> is a high-impact journal that frequently publishes collaborative research involving numerous contributors. Moreover, the authors' names might be presented in a format that is not immediately clear to students unfamiliar with scientific publications.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Open the article on the <em>Advanced Materials</em> website.<br />
2. Locate the "Author Information" section, which is typically found at the beginning or end of the article.<br />
3. List the authors in the order they appear, as this order reflects their contribution and importance to the research.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Student lists authors randomly as "Smith, J., Doe, J., and Brown, A."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Correctly listed as "Doe, J., Smith, J., &amp; Brown, A."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently misinterpret the publication date format used by <em>Advanced Materials</em>, which can lead to incorrect citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal often provides multiple dates, such as the date of submission, revision, acceptance, and online publication. Students might mistakenly use the submission or acceptance date instead of the publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the "Published Online" date, which is the correct date to use for APA citations.<br />
2. Format the date in the APA style: Year, Month Day.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Citation uses "Submitted: March 1, 2022."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Correct citation uses "Published Online: May 15, 2022."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Managing URLs from <em>Advanced Materials</em> can be tricky, especially when dealing with long or complex addresses that may break across lines in a document.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal's website often generates lengthy URLs that are not user-friendly. When students copy and paste these URLs into their references, they may encounter formatting issues.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use a DOI instead of a URL whenever possible, as DOIs are stable and preferred in APA citations.<br />
2. If a DOI is unavailable, ensure the URL is complete and correct.<br />
3. Use a URL shortener if necessary, but only if the original URL is exceptionally long and might break across lines.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.20210012345"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202100123"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes cite articles without realizing they are behind a paywall or require institutional access, which can be problematic for readers trying to access the source.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Advanced Materials</em> is a subscription-based journal, meaning many of its articles are not freely accessible without an institutional login or subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Verify access by logging in through your institution’s library portal or using interlibrary loan services.<br />
2. If citing a source from a paywalled article, consider including a note about access restrictions in the reference list if the assignment guidelines allow for it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Student provides a citation without noting access restrictions.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Citation remains the same, but the student ensures they have access through their institution or notes the restriction if necessary.</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues with specific solutions, students can effectively navigate the unique challenges presented by citing articles from <em>Advanced Materials</em> in APA format.</p>
