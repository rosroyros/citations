<p><strong>Expert Systems with Applications-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing the journal "Expert Systems with Applications" in APA 7th edition, students should adhere to the standard guidelines for journal articles while paying attention to specific nuances related to this source. Typically, APA requires listing up to 20 authors by their last names and initials. For "Expert Systems with Applications," the same rule applies: list all authors up to 20. If there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis, and then add the final author's name. This format ensures that the citation remains comprehensive yet concise. </p>
<p>One area where students often err is in the proper formatting of the journal title and volume number. In APA format, the journal title should be italicized and presented in title case, whereas the volume number should also be italicized but appear in plain text. Another common point of confusion involves articles with digital object identifiers (DOIs). For "Expert Systems with Applications," always include the DOI in the format: https://doi.org/xxxx. This is crucial for directing readers to the original source. Best practices for citing this journal include double-checking the accuracy of the DOI, author order, and ensuring all punctuation aligns with APA standards. Additionally, students should verify that they have copied the title of the article and journal correctly, as errors in capitalization or punctuation are frequent traps. By paying close attention to these details, students can avoid common citation pitfalls.</p>
