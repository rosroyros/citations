<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Nature Machine Intelligence-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em> requires attention to specific formatting guidelines that differ slightly from standard APA 7th edition rules. One key distinction is the treatment of author names. While APA typically lists up to 20 authors with their last names followed by initials, <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em> maintains the traditional scientific journal style of listing all authors, no matter the number, which can be a common point of confusion for students accustomed to APA's rules. Additionally, this journal uses a specific citation format that includes the article's title in sentence case, and the journal's name in italics, followed by the volume number in bold, the issue number in parentheses, and the page range.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect is the DOI format, which should be presented as a full URL, consistent with APA's guidelines. However, students often overlook the importance of including the DOI or misformat it, which is crucial for digital journal articles. Best practices for citing <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em> include carefully reviewing the journal's guidelines to ensure that all authors are listed, and checking for the correct placement and formatting of the volume, issue, and page numbers. To avoid common mistakes, students should double-check the DOI format and ensure that it leads directly to the article. By paying close attention to these details, students can accurately cite this source and maintain academic integrity.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-nature-machine-intelligence">Common Issues When Citing Nature Machine Intelligence</h2>
<p><strong>Identifying Authors in Nature Machine Intelligence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct list of authors when citing articles from Nature Machine Intelligence. This is particularly challenging when dealing with articles that have multiple authors or articles that include contributions from editorial teams.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Nature Machine Intelligence, like other Nature journals, often publishes research involving collaborative work from multiple authors. These articles can list numerous contributors, and sometimes the interface of the journal's website can make it difficult to discern the primary authors from the editorial or contributing authors.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Navigate to the article's landing page on the Nature Machine Intelligence website.<br />
2. Look for a section titled "Authors" or "Contributors" at the beginning of the article or just below the title.<br />
3. Ensure you list all authors as presented, following the format: Last name, Initials.<br />
4. If the article lists "et al." after a few authors, visit the PDF or supplementary material to find the full list.<br />
5. Verify the order and names carefully before using them in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- Before: Incorrectly listing authors as "Smith, J., et al."<br />
- After: Correctly listing all authors: "Smith, J., Doe, A., Roe, B., &amp; Clark, C."</p>
<p><strong>Date Formats in Nature Machine Intelligence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often confuse the publication date formats when citing articles from Nature Machine Intelligence, especially when the article provides multiple dates (e.g., received, accepted, published).</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Nature Machine Intelligence articles typically include multiple date stamps, such as submission, acceptance, and publication dates. The prominence given to different dates can vary, causing confusion regarding which date to use for citation.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always use the publication date, which is the date the article was published online.<br />
2. This date can usually be found near the article title or in the citation information section.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- Before: Using the submission date "Received: March 5, 2023."<br />
- After: Using the correct publication date "Published: June 15, 2023."</p>
<p><strong>Handling URLs in Nature Machine Intelligence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Citing URLs from Nature Machine Intelligence poses challenges, particularly when dealing with DOI links and article-specific URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Nature journals, including Nature Machine Intelligence, often provide both a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and a URL. Students might be unsure which to use or how to format them correctly in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Prefer using the DOI over the URL, as it is a permanent identifier.<br />
2. Use the format "https://doi.org/xxxxxx" where "xxxxxx" is the specific DOI for the article.<br />
3. If a DOI is unavailable, use the full URL of the article's landing page, ensuring to check that it is not behind a paywall or login.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- Before: Using the article's URL "https://www.nature.com/articles/natmachintell2023xyz"<br />
- After: Using the DOI "https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-023-00001"</p>
<p><strong>Access Requirements for Nature Machine Intelligence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may encounter access issues when trying to cite articles from Nature Machine Intelligence, especially if they are behind a paywall.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Nature Machine Intelligence is a subscription-based journal, which means that some articles might not be freely accessible to all students. This can lead to students citing articles they have not fully accessed or reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if your institution provides access to Nature Machine Intelligence through its library services.<br />
2. If not, consider reaching out to the authors for a copy, or use interlibrary loan services.<br />
3. Ensure you read and understand the content before citing it.</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues, students can improve the accuracy and reliability of their citations when referencing articles from Nature Machine Intelligence, adhering closely to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
