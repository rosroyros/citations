<p><strong>Neural Information Processing Systems-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing papers from the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference has unique considerations compared to standard APA 7th edition citation formats. NeurIPS is a prestigious conference in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and its citation format often aligns more closely with proceedings than with journal articles. In general, NeurIPS citations include the full names of all authors, the title of the paper, the name of the conference, the year of publication, and the page range. For instance, a typical citation might look like this: Last Name, First Initial. (Year). Title of the paper. In Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. xx-xx).</p>
<p>A notable difference from standard APA citation rules is that NeurIPS citations often require the inclusion of the conference name in italics, followed by the page numbers, rather than the volume or issue number common in journal citations. Students often confuse the inclusion of conference details with journal specifics, leading to incorrect citations. Additionally, unlike the APA 7th edition's rule to list only the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis and the last author's name, NeurIPS citations typically list all authors without abbreviation, which may be extensive for large collaborative works.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should ensure they accurately include all authors' names and avoid truncating the author list as per APA's general guidance. It's also crucial to italicize the conference name and correctly format the page range. Reviewing the conference's citation guidelines or using citation tools that cater to conference proceedings can be beneficial. By paying attention to these specific details, students can ensure their NeurIPS citations are both accurate and compliant with expected academic standards.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-neural-information-processing-systems">Common Issues When Citing Neural Information Processing Systems</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-finding-authors">Problem 1: Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
One common issue students face when citing papers from Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) is accurately identifying all contributing authors. This problem often arises due to the complex nature of collaborative research in the field of computer science and machine learning, where a large number of authors may contribute to a single paper.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
NeurIPS papers frequently involve multiple authors, sometimes exceeding a dozen. The conference proceedings may not clearly list all authors in the initial view, requiring additional navigation to find the complete list. This can lead to incomplete citations if students rely solely on the most visible information.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Visit the official NeurIPS proceedings website.<br />
2. Locate the specific paper you want to cite.<br />
3. Click on the paper title to open its detailed view.<br />
4. Look for a section labeled "Authors" or similar, and ensure you see the complete list.<br />
5. Copy all authors' names as they appear.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong><br />
Doe, J. (2023). Example Paper Title. Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems.</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Zhang, Y. (2023). Example Paper Title. Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often misformat the publication date when citing NeurIPS papers, potentially due to confusion over the conference year versus the publication year.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
NeurIPS papers are typically presented at the conference in December, but the official publication date might be the following year. Students may incorrectly use the conference year instead of verifying the actual publication year.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Confirm the publication year by checking the conference proceedings or the paper's metadata on the official NeurIPS website.<br />
2. Use the verified publication year in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Zhang, Y. (2022). Example Paper Title. Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems.</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Zhang, Y. (2023). Example Paper Title. Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Another issue is handling URLs for NeurIPS papers, especially in terms of ensuring persistent access and proper formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
NeurIPS proceedings are available online, but URLs can be lengthy or subject to change. Students might use unstable links or fail to format them correctly, leading to citations that do not consistently lead back to the source.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) when available, as it provides a stable, permanent link to the paper.<br />
2. If a DOI is not available, use the official NeurIPS URL but ensure it is as direct and stable as possible.<br />
3. Format the URL to start with "https://" for consistency and to ensure accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong><br />
Retrieved from www.neurips.cc/Conference/2023/ExamplePaper</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong><br />
Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.5555/neurips.2023.example</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes encounter access issues when attempting to cite NeurIPS papers, particularly when the papers are behind paywalls or require institutional access.</p>
<p><strong>Why it Happens:</strong><br />
While many NeurIPS papers are freely available, some might be restricted based on institutional subscriptions or conference access settings. This can be confusing when trying to retrieve and cite papers accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Check if your institution has access to NeurIPS proceedings. Use library resources or proxy login if necessary.<br />
2. Alternatively, search for pre-prints of the paper on platforms like arXiv, as many authors upload their work there.<br />
3. Always note the access date if you used an online source that could change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Zhang, Y. (2023). Example Paper Title. Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems. Retrieved from www.neurips.cc/Conference/2023/ExamplePaper</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong><br />
