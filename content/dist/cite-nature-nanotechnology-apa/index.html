<h2 id="quick-reference-nature-nanotechnology-citations">Quick Reference: Nature Nanotechnology Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Nature Nanotechnology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em> involves following a specific format that differs somewhat from standard APA 7th edition citation rules. In <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>, as with other Nature journals, the authors' names in the reference list should be formatted with the authors' initials following their last names, but without spacing between initials. For example, "Smith J, Brown AB" instead of "Smith, J., &amp; Brown, A. B." as you would see in APA. Additionally, <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em> does not use italics for journal titles, nor does it require the article title to be included in the reference list. The reference ends with the volume number, issue number (in parentheses), and page range, without the use of "pp." or "p." before the page numbers.</p>
<p>One key difference with <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em> is the inclusion of up to 20 authors in the reference list. Unlike APA, which uses an ellipsis after the 19th author when there are more than 20 authors, <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em> lists up to 20 authors before employing an ellipsis. This can lead to confusion, as students familiar with APA may inadvertently truncate the author list prematurely. Additionally, students often mistakenly italicize journal titles or include article titles, following APA habits.</p>
<p>To avoid these common pitfalls, students should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the specific guidelines provided by <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>. Double-checking the format against examples from recent articles published in the journal is a practical strategy. Students should also pay special attention to punctuation and author initials to ensure they follow the journal's unique requirements. Keeping a checklist of these key distinctions can be particularly helpful in maintaining accuracy and consistency in citations.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />

<h4 id="why-it-happens_3">Why It Happens</h4>
<p><em>Nature Nanotechnology</em> often requires a subscription for full-text access, which can complicate the citation process for students who do not have direct access.</p>
<h4 id="solution_3">Solution</h4>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you have access through your institution or library; if not, use the abstract or a summary if permitted.</li>
<li>Do not include access dates or retrieval information unless the content is likely to change over time.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved from https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano201911</p>
<p><strong>After Example:</strong><br />
No access date or retrieval information needed if the article has a DOI.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Citing articles from <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em> presents unique challenges, from identifying authors correctly to dealing with access issues.
