<h2 id="quick-reference-computers-education-citations">Quick Reference: Computers &amp; Education Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Computers &amp; Education-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the journal "Computers &amp; Education," it is essential to adhere to the general principles of APA 7th edition while also being aware of nuances specific to this publication. The standard APA format applies, which involves listing up to 20 authors by last name and initials. However, a particular point of confusion arises from the journal's emphasis on digital object identifiers (DOIs), which must be included in the citation if available. For instance, after the article title and journal volume, issue, and page numbers, you must add the DOI in the format: https://doi.org/xx.xxxxxxxx.</p>
<p>Unlike some sources where a URL may suffice, "Computers &amp; Education" often necessitates this precise DOI usage to ensure the article's traceability. This sometimes leads to student errors, such as omitting the DOI or formatting it incorrectly, which can detract from the citation's accuracy and adherence to APA guidelines. Additionally, students might struggle with understanding when to italicize elements; specifically, the journal title and volume number should be italicized, not the issue number or page range.</p>
<p>To avoid pitfalls, students should double-check all available author names up to 20, ensure they employ the correct DOI format, and consult the journal's official website or a library database for accurate citation details. This diligence helps maintain consistency and precision, reflecting a professional approach to academic writing. Lastly, using reference management tools can aid in formatting citations correctly, reducing manual errors.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-computers-education">Common Issues When Citing Computers &amp; Education</h2>
<p><strong>Issue 1: Identifying Authors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list the authors of articles from Computers &amp; Education. This problem arises particularly when articles have multiple authors or when the author list is extensive.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Computers &amp; Education is a peer-reviewed journal that frequently publishes collaborative works involving multiple authors. The author information is typically listed at the beginning of the article, but distinguishing between primary authors and contributors can be confusing due to the formatting in the digital interface.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the article and navigate to the beginning, where the author list is usually found.<br />
2. Carefully read the author section to identify all contributors. Note that in APA format, all authors should be listed in the order they appear.<br />
3. For articles with up to 20 authors, list all authors by last name, followed by initials. For more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis (...), and then the final author’s name.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <em>Before</em>: "Smith, J., Doe, J., et al."<br />
- <em>After</em>: "Smith, J., Doe, J., Brown, L., &amp; White, M. (2023)."</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2: Date Formats</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students often encounter confusion regarding the correct date format when citing articles from Computers &amp; Education, especially since the journal may display multiple dates (e.g., submission, acceptance, and publication).</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Computers &amp; Education often provides several dates related to the publication process. The correct date to use in citations is the publication date, which can be overlooked if not clearly labeled.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the publication date on the article page, often labeled as "Published online" or "Published in issue."<br />
2. Use the year of publication in your citation.<br />
3. In the reference list, the format should be: (Year, Month Day). If only the year is available, use just the year.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <em>Before</em>: "(Accepted 2023)"<br />
- <em>After</em>: "(2023, March 15)"</p>
<p><strong>Issue 3: URL Handling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Handling URLs for articles from Computers &amp; Education can be problematic, particularly when articles are accessed through institutional databases where direct URLs are not stable.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
URLs provided by databases might include session-specific information that becomes invalid after the session ends. Computers &amp; Education articles accessed through platforms like Elsevier may include such URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. When available, use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) instead of a URL, as it provides a stable link.<br />
2. If a DOI is not available, use the journal’s homepage URL.<br />
3. Ensure that the DOI is formatted as a hyperlink, beginning with "https://doi.org/".</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <em>Before</em>: "Retrieved from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131519302019"<br />
- <em>After</em>: "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104123"</p>
<p><strong>Issue 4: Access Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong><br />
Students sometimes fail to account for access restrictions when citing articles, particularly when they rely on institutional access that others may not have.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Access to Computers &amp; Education articles might be restricted by paywalls or require an institutional login, which students might not realize when preparing citations for a general audience.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Do not include database or institutional access information in the citation.<br />
2. Use the DOI, which is universally accessible and bypasses access restrictions.<br />
3. If a DOI is unavailable, mention only the journal’s homepage URL, which avoids access-related issues.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <em>Before</em>: "Retrieved from University Library"<br />
- <em>After</em>: "Available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104123"</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation challenges, students can accurately and effectively cite articles from Computers &amp; Education in their academic work.</p>
