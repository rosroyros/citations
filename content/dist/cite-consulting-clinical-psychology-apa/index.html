<p><strong>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the <em>Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology</em> (JCCP) in APA 7th edition, the primary focus is on adhering to the standard APA guidelines for journal articles, as there are no unique requirements specific to this journal that deviate significantly from general APA practices. However, students often encounter confusion with specific elements such as the list of authors and the requirements for DOI inclusion. For articles with up to 20 authors, APA 7th edition mandates listing every author by last name followed by initials, separated by commas, and using an ampersand before the last author. This rule applies to JCCP articles as well, ensuring that all authors receive proper attribution.</p>
<p>One area where students often err is in the presentation of the DOI, which should be formatted as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy). Unlike other citation styles, APA 7th edition requires the DOI to be hyperlinked and active, which is a critical consideration when citing JCCP articles. Additionally, students must ensure they use the correct italicization for the article title, journal name, and volume number, while the issue number should be in parentheses and not italicized. Best practices involve double-checking the journal’s website for any specific submission guidelines and ensuring compliance with APA rules to avoid errors. By carefully adhering to these details, students can ensure accurate and effective citations of JCCP articles.</p>
