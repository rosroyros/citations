<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Energy Storage Materials-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from "Energy Storage Materials" requires attention to detail, as this journal may have specific formatting requirements that differ from general APA guidelines. The journal typically follows the standard scientific citation style, which often includes the use of numerical citations in-text and a numbered reference list at the end of the document. However, when adhering to APA 7th edition guidelines for educational purposes, it is essential to adapt this to the author-date citation format, which involves listing authors' last names followed by their initials, the publication year, the title of the article, the journal name in italics, volume number, and page range.</p>
<p>Where "Energy Storage Materials" diverges from APA norms, particularly for the number of authors, is in listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis to omit any additional authors. This means that if an article has more than 20 authors, you list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the name of the last author. This can be a common point of confusion, as students familiar with the APA limit of 20 may mistakenly truncate the list earlier.</p>
<p>To avoid these pitfalls, students should consult both the journal's specific citation guidelines and APA 7th edition rules. A best practice is to double-check the journal's instructions or use citation management tools that support both APA and the journal's format. Familiarity with these nuances will help students accurately represent their sources and maintain academic integrity.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-energy-storage-materials">Common Issues When Citing Energy Storage Materials</h2>
<p><strong>1. Identifying Authors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often face difficulties in correctly identifying and listing authors when citing articles from "Energy Storage Materials." This journal, like many others, often includes multiple authors or uses non-standard author names, such as initials or hyphenated names, which can complicate citation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
In "Energy Storage Materials," articles frequently have numerous contributors due to the collaborative nature of scientific research. Additionally, the use of initials, hyphenated names, and international contributors with varying name structures can lead to confusion in properly listing all authors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Always start by locating the 'Authors' section at the top of the article or in the accompanying citation information.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> Ensure you list all authors in the order they are presented, as it reflects their contribution hierarchy.<br />
- <strong>Step 3:</strong> For authors with initials or hyphenated names, use the format provided by the journal. For example, if an author is listed as "J. Doe-Smith," use this exact format in your citation.<br />
- <strong>Step 4:</strong> Use an online reference manager or the journal's citation tool to double-check your author list.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Doe, J. S., Smith, A., &amp; Brown, T.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Doe-Smith, J., Smith, A., &amp; Brown, T.</p>
<p><strong>2. Date Formats</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly formatting dates in citations, especially when dealing with articles that may have an online publication date different from the print date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
"Energy Storage Materials" articles may have different publication dates for online and print versions. The confusion arises when students are unsure which date to use or how to format them according to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the online publication date if the article is accessed online, as it is the most relevant in digital contexts.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> Format the date in the year-month-day format, as recommended by APA.<br />
- <strong>Step 3:</strong> If both online and print versions are available, prioritize the online date for digital citations.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> (2022, June)<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2022, June 15)</p>
<p><strong>3. URL Handling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Citing URLs from "Energy Storage Materials" can be problematic, particularly when dealing with DOI links or subscription-based access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal often provides DOI links, which are stable and preferred in academic work, but students sometimes mistakenly use temporary session URLs or omit the DOI altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Always use the DOI link provided by the journal, as it is permanent and will not change.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> If a DOI is available, format it correctly by using the prefix "https://doi.org/" followed by the DOI number.<br />
- <strong>Step 3:</strong> Ensure you have access to the full article to verify the DOI and other citation details.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from http://energystoragematerials.com/article/12345<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensm.2022.06.015</p>
<p><strong>4. Access Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes encounter issues with access requirements when citing articles from "Energy Storage Materials," especially those behind paywalls.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Many articles in "Energy Storage Materials" are behind subscription-based access, which can lead students to improperly cite or reference incomplete information from abstracts or summaries.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Verify your institution's access to the journal through library resources.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use interlibrary loan services if direct access is unavailable.<br />
- <strong>Step 3:</strong> Never cite from an abstract; always ensure you have access to the full text.</p>
<p>By addressing these common citation problems with practical solutions, students can confidently and accurately cite articles from "Energy Storage Materials," adhering to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
