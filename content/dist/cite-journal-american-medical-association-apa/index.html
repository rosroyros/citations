<p><strong>Journal of the American Medical Association-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) requires adherence to specific formatting rules that differ slightly from general APA citation practices. One key distinction is the way authors are listed. While APA style typically allows for listing up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis, JAMA citations necessitate listing all authors regardless of number. This can be a point of confusion, especially for students accustomed to the APA rule of truncating long author lists. Additionally, when citing JAMA articles, the article's volume number should be in italics, and the issue number should be in parentheses immediately following the volume number, without being italicized. This differs from the APA practice of italicizing both the volume and issue numbers.</p>
<p>For students, a common mistake is misapplying APA's more flexible author listing rules to JAMA articles. To avoid this, it is crucial to meticulously list every author in the order they appear in the publication. Another potential pitfall is formatting the journal title and volume correctly; consistency here is key. Best practices include double-checking the journal's official style guide to ensure compliance with JAMA-specific requirements, and cross-referencing with APA guidelines to manage elements like DOI formatting. Always pay close attention to detail, particularly with author names and publication details, to ensure precision and alignment with the unique expectations of JAMA citations.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying the Article Title</strong>: The article title is prominently displayed at the top of the page, above the author byline and publication date. It is typically in a larger and bolder font, making it easy to identify. Ensure you transcribe the title exactly as it appears, including any subtitles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL and Access Information</strong>: The URL, essential for accessing the article, is located in the browser’s address bar. When citing, ensure you copy the complete URL starting with "https://". JAMA articles often have a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) listed near the article title or abstract, which provides a permanent link to the digital article and should be included in your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: In some cases, you might need additional details such as the volume and issue number, page range, or DOI for a complete citation. This information is usually found on the right side of the page under the “Article Information” section. This section may also include the article’s abstract, keywords, and links to related content.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-journal-of-the-american-medical-association">Common Issues When Citing Journal of the American Medical Association</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and order the authors when citing articles from the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Given the frequent presence of multiple authors, this can become a cumbersome task.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
JAMA often publishes articles with a large number of contributors. The complexity increases as students may encounter author lists that are truncated with "et al." in the journal’s HTML view, leading to confusion about the complete list of authors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always access the full-text PDF version of the article when available. This version typically lists all authors in the correct order.<br />
2. Use JAMA’s official citation information usually provided at the end of the article, which includes the complete list of authors.<br />
3. For articles with more than 20 authors, list the first 19 authors followed by an ellipsis (…) and then the final author's name, as per APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith J, et al.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith J, Johnson R, Williams T, Brown L, et al.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may incorrectly format publication dates, especially when articles are published online ahead of print, which is common in JAMA.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
JAMA articles often feature an “online first” publication date, which precedes the final publication date in a physical issue. This can lead to confusion about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the "online first" date if the article does not yet have an issue number or page range.<br />
2. Once the article appears in a regular issue, use the print publication date.<br />
3. Format the date in parentheses in the year-month-day sequence, as per APA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023, August 15)</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with how to properly include URLs for JAMA articles, particularly when articles are accessed through academic databases that might not provide a direct URL.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
JAMA articles accessed via libraries or institutional subscriptions may not always provide a stable URL. Moreover, DOI links are preferred in APA citation but may not always be readily visible.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the DOI link, which is a permanent identifier, if available. Preface it with "https://doi.org/".<br />
2. If no DOI is available, use the stable URL provided by the journal.<br />
3. Avoid using URLs from databases like PubMed or library proxies that may not be accessible to all readers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.jama.com/article123<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2023.123456</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not properly note access requirements for JAMA articles, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br />
JAMA articles may be behind paywalls, requiring institutional access or subscription. This can affect the accessibility of the article for readers reviewing the citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Ensure that when citing such articles, no indication of restricted access is needed in the citation itself.<br />
2. While indicating "Retrieved from" is not required in APA 7th edition for DOIs, ensure access is available through appropriate institutional links if needed.<br />
3. For personal reference, maintain a list of access credentials or library services to easily access these articles.</p>
<p>By focusing on these specific issues and solutions, students can significantly improve their citation practices when working with JAMA articles, aligning with APA 7th edition guidelines and ensuring accuracy and accessibility in their references.</p>
