Agency Name. (Year). <em>Title of report</em> (Report No. XXX, if available). Publisher. https://www.example.gov/report</p>
<p><strong>The White House-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing The White House in APA 7th edition, it is critical to understand its unique formatting requirements compared to general government agency citations. In APA style, The White House is considered a distinctive entity and should be directly named as the author, rather than listing it under "U.S. Government" or another broader category. This means that in your reference list, you should begin with "The White House" as the author, followed by the publication year, title of the document in italics, and then the URL if it is an online source. For example: The White House. (2022). Title of the document. URL.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises when students attempt to apply generic government citation rules, which often involve listing the department and its subdivisions. However, The White House is treated uniquely because it serves as both the author and publisher in many cases. Students might mistakenly attribute a document to a specific office within The White House, but APA guidelines specify that "The White House" should stand alone as the author when it is the primary entity responsible for the content.</p>
<p>To avoid common pitfalls, students should ensure they are attributing documents specifically to The White House when it is explicitly stated as the author. Furthermore, it is vital to double-check the document's publication details to ensure accuracy. Students should also remember that, unlike some other government documents, the specific date of publication (not just year) should be included if available, as this can affect the relevancy and retrieval of the source. Following these best practices will help ensure that citations are both accurate and conform to APA standards.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-the-white-house">Where to Find Citation Information on The White House</h2>
<p>Navigating The White House website (https://www.whitehouse.gov) to gather citation information requires a keen eye for detail due to its unique layout, which is designed to provide official information efficiently. Understanding where to locate citation elements such as the author, publication date, title, and URL will ensure that your citations are accurate and complete, specifically in the context of APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>On The White House website, articles and press releases often do not have a specific author listed. Instead, they are attributed to the White House as an institution. In such cases, APA 7th edition allows you to use the organization as the author. When citing, you should list "The White House" as the author in your reference entry. If a specific author's name is provided, it will usually appear at the top of the article, just below the headline or in the introductory section.</p>
<h3 id="publication-date">Publication Date</h3>
<p>The publication date is typically presented directly below the headline of the article or press release. This date is formatted in a straightforward manner, usually including the month, day, and year, making it easy to locate. Record the full date as it appears, as APA format requires the year, followed by the month and day in the reference list.</p>
<h3 id="title">Title</h3>
<p>The title of the content is prominently displayed at the top of the page in a larger font size, making it the most noticeable part of the page. Ensure you capture the complete title, including any subtitles, as it appears on the website. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and specificity of your citation.</p>
<h3 id="urlaccess-information">URL/Access Information</h3>
<p>The URL can be found in the browser's address bar. It is crucial to copy the entire URL exactly as it appears to ensure that your reader can access the same content. APA 7th edition requires the inclusion of a retrieval date only if the content is likely to change over time, which is not typically the case with official documents on The White House website. Therefore, you can generally omit the retrieval date unless specified otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="navigational-tips">Navigational Tips</h3>
<p>To efficiently find articles or press releases, use the search bar located at the top right corner of the homepage. You can enter keywords related to your topic to narrow down relevant documents. Additionally, the website's menu, which includes sections like "Briefing Room" and "Issues," can guide you to specific types of content.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you can accurately collect and cite information from The White House website, ensuring your academic work upholds the standards of clarity and reliability.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-the-white-house">Common Issues When Citing The White House</h2>
<h3 id="identifying-the-author">Identifying the Author</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
When citing The White House website, students often struggle with identifying the correct author because the content is usually attributed to the institution rather than a specific person.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The White House's website content, such as press releases or policy statements, is often published under the institution's name rather than an individual author. This can be confusing as students are accustomed to looking for individual authors in other sources.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
In APA format, when a work does not have an individual author, the organization should be listed as the author. In this case, use "The White House" as the author.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Author: Not Specified<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Author: The White House</p>
<h3 id="formatting-the-date">Formatting the Date</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often encounter difficulties in properly formatting dates from The White House website due to variations in date presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The White House website might display dates in formats not directly aligned with APA guidelines, such as using full month names or including time stamps.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
In APA 7th edition, the date should be formatted as Year, Month Day. Ensure that you convert any date formats to this structure.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Date: September 15, 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Date: 2023, September 15</p>
<h3 id="handling-urls">Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes omit URLs or include incorrect ones in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The White House website often has lengthy URLs, and students might either truncate them or forget to include them altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Always include the full URL. In APA, it is important to provide a direct link to the specific page or document you are referencing. Ensure the URL is entered accurately and completely.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> URL: www.whitehouse.gov<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> URL: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/15/specific-press-release</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may be confused about whether to note access requirements or retrieval dates for sources from The White House.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Some online sources require subscription access or are periodically updated, which affects citation. However, The White House website is publicly accessible, yet students might be unsure about whether retrieval dates are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
For websites like The White House that are publicly accessible and unlikely to change frequently, you do not need to include a retrieval date unless the content is expected to change over time.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.whitehouse.gov on September 15, 2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Retrieved from https://www.whitehouse.gov</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>
<p>A complete citation for a page from The White House website might look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Example Citation:</strong><br />
The White House. (2023, September 15). Title of the specific webpage. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/15/specific-press-release</p>
<p>By understanding how to correctly identify the author, format dates, handle URLs, and determine access requirements, students can effectively cite The White House as a source in their academic work. These steps not only adhere to APA 7th edition guidelines but also enhance the credibility and accuracy of their research.</p>
