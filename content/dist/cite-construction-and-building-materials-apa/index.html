<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Construction and Building Materials-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from the journal <em>Construction and Building Materials</em> generally follows the standard APA 7th edition guidelines, but there are nuances to be aware of that can cause confusion. One distinct aspect of citing this journal is the format of the article title and journal name. In APA, the article title should be in sentence case, meaning only the first word of the title, the first word after a colon, and proper nouns are capitalized. The journal name, <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>, should be in title case and italicized. An often-overlooked detail is the inclusion of the volume number, which is italicized, followed by the issue number in parentheses (if available), and then the page range.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises when listing authors in citations. For works with up to 20 authors, APA 7th edition requires listing all authors, using an ampersand before the last author's name. This is particularly relevant for <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>, as articles can have numerous contributors. Students frequently forget to include all authors or improperly format their names, using initials for first and middle names. For example, an author is cited as "Smith, J. A." rather than "John A. Smith."</p>
<p>Best practices for citing <em>Construction and Building Materials</em> include double-checking the details like DOI inclusion and ensuring all author names are accurately presented. Using citation management tools can help, but students should verify the generated citation against APA guidelines. Additionally, attention to detail in page formatting—such as the correct placement of commas, periods, and italicization—is crucial to avoid common errors.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-construction-and-building-materials">Common Issues When Citing Construction and Building Materials</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify and list the authors of articles from the journal <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>. This can lead to incorrect citations if the authors are not accurately represented.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Construction and Building Materials</em> is a peer-reviewed journal that often publishes articles with multiple authors, sometimes up to ten or more. The interface where these articles are accessed, such as databases like ScienceDirect, can display authors in a different format compared to other journals. Authors may be listed with initials and last names only, or in a format that is not immediately clear, which can confuse students.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access the Article:</strong> Use a reliable academic database such as ScienceDirect to ensure you are viewing the official publication details.<br />
2. <strong>Locate Author List:</strong> Check both the article's title page and the end of the article where author contributions are often detailed.<br />
3. <strong>List Authors in Order:</strong> Follow the order provided by the journal without alteration. APA 7th edition requires listing up to 20 authors.<br />
4. <strong>Use Correct Format:</strong> Authors should be listed as Last Name, Initial(s). E.g., Smith, J. A., &amp; Doe, R. B.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "John Smith et al."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Smith, J. A., Doe, R. B., &amp; Johnson, L. M."</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students frequently misapply the date format required by APA when citing articles from <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Journals like <em>Construction and Building Materials</em> often list multiple dates (e.g., submission, acceptance, and publication dates). Students might confuse these dates, leading to an incorrect citation.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Identify the Publication Date:</strong> Use the publication date, which is typically listed near the article title or abstract on the journal's webpage.<br />
2. <strong>Use APA Format:</strong> In APA 7th edition, the publication year should be included in parentheses immediately after the author names. If no year is available, use "n.d." for "no date."</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Smith, J. (Accepted: 2023)."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Smith, J. (2023)."</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Inappropriately handling URLs when citing journal articles online is another common issue, particularly with <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles from <em>Construction and Building Materials</em> are often accessed through databases like ScienceDirect, which can provide long and complex URLs. Additionally, students might be unsure whether to include the URL of the database or the DOI.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOIs When Available:</strong> APA 7th edition prefers DOIs over URLs. Look for a DOI on the article's main page or within the article PDF.<br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI Correctly:</strong> Present the DOI as a URL (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.126917).<br />
3. <strong>If No DOI, Use URL:</strong> If a DOI is not available, use the most direct and stable URL, preferably the journal's page on the publisher's site.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Retrieved from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061819306528"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.126917"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Accessing full-text articles in <em>Construction and Building Materials</em> can be problematic if students do not have the necessary subscriptions or institutional access.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Many academic journals, including <em>Construction and Building Materials</em>, require a subscription or institutional access for full-text viewing. This can lead students to incorrectly cite abstracts or incomplete information.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Verify Access:</strong> Check if your institution provides access through its library portal.<br />
2. <strong>Use Interlibrary Loan:</strong> If access is not available, consider requesting the article through interlibrary loan services.<br />
3. <strong>Cite What You Accessed:</strong> If you only accessed the abstract, ensure your citation reflects this, although full-text is preferred.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Citing only the abstract without noting restrictions.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Ensure citation reflects full access, or note in the text that only the abstract was reviewed.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-construction-and-building-materials">Frequently Asked Questions About Construction and Building Materials</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How can I find the necessary citation information for an article from the Construction and Building Materials website?</strong></p>
<p>A: To find citation information, navigate to the article's webpage on the Construction and Building Materials website. Look for sections labeled "Citation," "References," or "Export Citation," which often provide formatted citation details. You can also manually gather information such as authors, publication year, article title, journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers from the article's header or abstract page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I handle unique author formats when citing articles from Construction and Building Materials?</strong></p>
<p>A: Construction and Building Materials often includes articles with multiple authors. In APA format, list up to 20 authors by their last names followed by initials, separated by commas, and use an ampersand (&amp;) before the final author's name. If there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19, insert an ellipsis (. . .), and then add the final author's name.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I correctly format the publication date for articles from Construction and Building Materials?</strong></p>
<p>A: In APA format, the publication date is placed in parentheses immediately after the author's names. For Construction and Building Materials, use the year of publication, which can be found on the article's webpage or PDF, and omit the day and month unless they are explicitly provided, which is uncommon in journal articles.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the requirements for URLs and access dates when citing articles from Construction and Building Materials?</strong></p>
<p>A: In APA 7th edition, include the URL in your citation if it is available. You do not need to include an access date unless the content is likely to change over time (e.g., wikis). For articles accessed through a database, use the DOI instead of a URL if it is available.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing articles from Construction and Building Materials differ from other journal article sources in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: While the basic APA format for journal articles applies (author(s), year, title, journal, volume, issue, pages, DOI/URL), Construction and Building Materials may have specific nuances such as a larger number of authors in collaborative studies. Always ensure to check for a DOI, which is commonly assigned to articles from this journal, providing a stable link that differentiates it from other sources that might not have a DOI.</p>
