Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Social Psychology and Personality Science-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Social Psychology and Personality Science" (SPPS) follows general APA 7th edition guidelines but with specific nuances that students should note. One key aspect of citing articles from this journal is ensuring that the title of the journal is italicized and capitalized properly. In APA format, after the article title, the journal name, volume number, and issue number should all be italicized, while the issue number is placed in parentheses immediately after the volume number, followed by a comma. For example, "Social Psychology and Personality Science, 12(3), 123-134."</p>
<p>A distinct difference when citing SPPS compared to general APA citation rules involves the listing of authors. In most APA citations, up to 20 authors can be listed before using an ellipsis to represent additional authors. However, SPPS articles often have numerous authors, and students should be diligent in listing all authors for articles with up to 20 authors. If there are more, list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis, and then the final author's name. This can be a common point of confusion, but following the APA guideline strictly helps maintain consistency.</p>
<p>To avoid mistakes, students should double-check the formatting of each part of the citation, especially paying attention to italicization and punctuation, as these are frequent areas of error. Utilizing citation management tools like Zotero or EndNote can help automate this process, though manual verification is always recommended. Lastly, students should stay updated on any changes in the journal's citation practices or the APA guidelines, as these can occasionally be revised.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-social-psychology-and-personality-science">Common Issues When Citing Social Psychology and Personality Science</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with correctly identifying the authors of articles published in journals like Social Psychology and Personality Science. This confusion typically arises when multiple authors are involved, or when authors have similar names.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Social Psychology and Personality Science, like many academic journals, lists multiple authors, often with complex affiliations, which can overwhelm students. Sometimes, articles have authors with similar initials or last names, making it difficult to differentiate them.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Carefully Read the Author List:</strong> Access the article's main page on the journal's website where authors are clearly listed, usually below the article title.<br />
2. <strong>Check the Author Contribution Section:</strong> This section often provides clarity on each author's role, helping identify primary contributors.<br />
3. <strong>Use the PDF Version:</strong> The PDF of the article typically has a concise author list on the title page, which is easy to copy.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "(Smith, 2023)"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "(Smith, J., &amp; Doe, A., 2023)"</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Incorrect date formatting is a frequent mistake, especially when students are unsure whether to use the full date or just the year.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Social Psychology and Personality Science usually requires the use of the publication year for the citation, but students might mistakenly cite the full date due to confusion with online publication dates or updates.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Publication Date:</strong> Check the journal's webpage for the article; the publication year is often listed prominently.<br />
2. <strong>Use APA 7th Edition Guidelines:</strong> Only the publication year is required in the citation. </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "(Social Psychology and Personality Science, January 13, 2023)"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "(Social Psychology and Personality Science, 2023)"</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students might incorrectly handle URLs, especially when links are long or contain session-specific information.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Social Psychology and Personality Science provides direct URLs to articles, which can be lengthy or contain session-specific data, potentially leading to broken links.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOIs Instead of URLs:</strong> If available, a DOI is the preferred method of citation, as it provides a permanent link to the content.<br />
2. <strong>Check for Persistent Links:</strong> If using a URL, ensure it is a stable link rather than one generated from a session.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Retrieved from http://sessionbasedlink/12345"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550621990459"</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often forget or are unaware of access requirements, leading to incomplete or incorrect citations when the source is behind a paywall.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Social Psychology and Personality Science may require institutional access or a subscription, which can confuse students about what to include in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Access via University Library:</strong> Use institutional logins to access the journal through a university library portal.<br />
2. <strong>Note Access Information:</strong> If an article is behind a paywall, do not include access information in the citation; it is not required by APA.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Retrieved from [Journal Name] (subscription required)"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> No access statement needed, simply cite the DOI or stable URL.</p>
<p>By following these guidelines, students can accurately and effectively cite articles from Social Psychology and Personality Science, adhering to APA 7th edition standards and avoiding common pitfalls.</p>
