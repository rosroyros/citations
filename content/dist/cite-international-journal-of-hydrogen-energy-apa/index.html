<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from the "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy" in APA 7th edition, the process largely adheres to standard APA guidelines, but there are nuances worth noting to ensure accuracy. Typically, APA format requires listing up to 20 authors using their last names and initials, with an ampersand before the last author's name. The "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy" does not deviate from these conventions, so students should follow this rule closely. For instance, if an article has 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis, and then add the last author's name.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion arises with journal-specific elements such as volume and issue numbers. Students sometimes mistakenly omit the issue number if it is not provided, but for the "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy," it is crucial to include the volume number followed by the issue number in parentheses immediately after the journal title. Additionally, always provide the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) if available, as this ensures direct access to the source.</p>
<p>Best practices involve double-checking each author’s name and ensuring that the title of the article is in sentence case, while the journal name is in title case and italicized. These details are vital for maintaining consistency and professionalism in academic writing. By adhering to these guidelines, students can effectively cite articles from the "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy" and avoid common pitfalls that may affect the credibility of their work.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
- Use Journal Article format with International Journal of Hydrogen Energy specifics<br />

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-international-journal-of-hydrogen-energy">Common Issues When Citing International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
One common issue students face when citing articles from the <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> is correctly identifying all authors, especially in cases of multiple authorship or when differentiating between editorial staff and contributing authors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
This journal often features collaborative research with numerous contributors. The author list can be extensive and may be truncated in database search results or on the journal's browsing interface. Additionally, distinguishing between authors and editors can be confusing due to the layout of some articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. Access the full PDF version of the article to view the complete list of authors. The full text will typically list all contributors in the correct order.<br />
2. Refer to the article's title page or the section immediately following the abstract, where the authors' names are often listed comprehensively.<br />
3. Use the journal's online platform to view the article's details. This often provides a "Cite" feature, showing the complete list of authors.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Smith, J., &amp; et al. (2023)."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Smith, J., Doe, A., &amp; Brown, L. (2023)."</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes struggle with correctly formatting the publication date, especially when articles are published online before being assigned to an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> frequently publishes articles online ahead of print. These articles might only have a year of publication or a full date (year, month, day) if accessed early.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. Check the article's citation information on the journal's website or the publication itself. Use the "Online First" date if the article hasn't been assigned to an issue.<br />
2. If the full date is available, use the complete date format: year, month, and day (e.g., 2023, August 15).</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "(2023)."<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "(2023, August 15)."</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Properly including a URL in citations can be problematic, particularly when direct URLs from databases might not resolve correctly or are session-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal’s articles are often accessed via databases that generate session-specific URLs, which break upon subsequent access attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. Use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) instead of a session-specific URL. The DOI is a stable link that will always lead to the article.<br />
2. Locate the DOI on the article's webpage, typically in the citation information or the article's header/footer.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> "Retrieved from http://session-specific-url.com"<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.08.015"</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may cite articles without considering whether their readers can access them, especially if they are behind a paywall.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> is often available through institutional access but not freely accessible to the general public, leading to potential accessibility issues for readers without subscriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Steps:</strong><br />
1. Verify if the article is available through open access. Check for any "Open Access" labels or sections on the journal’s website.<br />
2. If behind a paywall, consider whether an institutional login can be used to access the article, and note this in your reference if necessary.<br />
3. Encourage checking if the article is available in a public repository or through a library service.</p>
<p><strong>Before/After Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> No mention of access restrictions.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> "Available through institutional access or at [library name]."</p>
<p>By understanding these specific challenges and applying these solutions, students can accurately and effectively cite articles from the <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em> in their academic work.</p>
