<h2 id="quick-reference-supreme-court-citations">Quick Reference: Supreme Court Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Agency Name. (Year). <em>Title of report</em> (Report No. XXX, if available). Publisher. https://www.example.gov/report</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing Supreme Court cases in APA 7th edition involves unique formatting requirements that differ from standard government agency citations. In APA style, when citing a Supreme Court case, the title of the case is italicized, and the volume number, the abbreviation for the U.S. Reports, and the page number are included. Additionally, the year of the decision is placed in parentheses at the end of the citation. For example: <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). This format is distinct because it does not include typical elements such as the author or publisher, focusing instead on the volume and page numbers of the U.S. Reports, where the decision is published.</p>
<p>A common point of confusion for students is the absence of an author or editor, which is typical in other government documents. Instead, the case name itself acts as the main component of the citation. Unlike other government documents that may list a government body as an author, Supreme Court cases prioritize the parties involved in the case. Students often mistakenly use the court's name or a judge’s name as the author, which is incorrect in this context.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should familiarize themselves with the structure and components of a Supreme Court citation. It is crucial to identify the correct case name, volume number, and page number from the U.S. Reports, ensuring these elements are accurately represented. Utilizing legal databases such as Westlaw or LexisNexis can aid in retrieving accurate case information. Additionally, students should be cautious not to confuse Supreme Court citations with those of lower courts, which might have different citation requirements. Understanding these nuances will help in creating precise and compliant citations for Supreme Court cases.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />
- Use Government Report format with Supreme Court specifics<br />
- Locate citation info on Supreme Court's website<br />
- Handle Supreme Court's unique formatting requirements</p>

<p>Navigating the Supreme Court website (https://www.supremecourt.gov) to find citation information is a crucial skill for students conducting legal or historical research. Here’s a detailed guide to help you locate the essential citation elements: author, publication date, title, and URL/access information.</p>
<h3 id="locating-citation-information">Locating Citation Information:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Author:</strong><br />
   - On the Supreme Court website, documents such as opinions, orders, and other legal materials typically do not list an individual author. Instead, they are collective works of the Court. When citing, you often use "Supreme Court of the United States" as the author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong><br />
   - For opinions and other dated documents, the publication date is typically found at the beginning of the document, immediately following the court's name or title of the opinion. For example, when you open a specific case's opinion document, look towards the top or first page where it indicates when the opinion was delivered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Title:</strong><br />
   - The title of the document is crucial for citation. On the Supreme Court website, the title is generally the case name or type of document. When you access the "Opinions" page, the case names are listed with docket numbers. For example, a case might be titled "Smith v. Jones." Click on the case name to access the full text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL/Access Information:</strong><br />
   - The URL is found in your browser's address bar. When you have navigated to a specific case or document, copy the complete URL to ensure direct access. For example, if you are on the page of a particular opinion, the URL might look like "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7m58.pdf."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="navigational-tips">Navigational Tips:</h3>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-supreme-court">Common Issues When Citing Supreme Court</h2>
<p>Citing Supreme Court decisions can be particularly challenging for students due to the unique nature of legal documents. In this guide, we will explore common citation issues students encounter when citing Supreme Court decisions and provide practical solutions adhering to APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to identify the "author" of Supreme Court decisions, as these documents are not attributed to a single person but to the court as an institution.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Unlike traditional academic papers or articles, Supreme Court decisions do not have a single author. Instead, they are the product of a collective judicial process.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
In APA format, the Supreme Court should be treated as the author. This reflects the institutional authorship of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the name of the court as the author.<br />
2. Use "U.S. Supreme Court" as the author in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> John Doe, Supreme Court Decision on Roe v. Wade, 1973.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (1973). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>.</p>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may be unsure about which date to use, as several important dates can be associated with a court decision.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Supreme Court decisions are often associated with multiple dates, including when oral arguments took place and when the decision was officially announced.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
In APA format, use the date when the decision was announced, as this reflects the moment it became public record.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Locate the date of decision announcement, usually found in the decision's header.<br />
2. Use this date in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (Argued December 13, 1971). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (1973). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>.</p>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often encounter issues with finding stable URLs for online Supreme Court decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Supreme Court decisions can be found on various websites, each potentially offering different URL structures. These URLs can change if the website's structure is updated.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Use a stable, official source like the Legal Information Institute (LII) at Cornell Law School or the official Supreme Court website, which offer permanent URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Search for the decision on a reliable source such as LII or the Supreme Court's official site.<br />
2. Copy the stable URL provided on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (1973). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>. Retrieved from http://example.com/decision<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (1973). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>. Retrieved from https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113</p>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students might not have access to certain databases where Supreme Court decisions are hosted.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Some databases require subscriptions or institutional access to view full texts of decisions, limiting student access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Utilize free and publicly accessible databases such as the Legal Information Institute or Google Scholar for full-text decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Solution:</strong><br />
1. Search for the decision on a free, accessible platform like LII or Google Scholar.<br />
2. If not available, consult your institution's library for access or alternative resources.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (1973). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>. Access required.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> U.S. Supreme Court. (1973). <em>Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113</em>. Retrieved from https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113</p>
<p>By addressing these common issues, students can effectively cite Supreme Court decisions in APA format, helping ensure their academic work meets rigorous scholarly standards.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-supreme-court">Frequently Asked Questions About Supreme Court</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How do I navigate the Supreme Court's website to find the necessary information for a citation in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: To find citation information, visit the Supreme Court's official website and access the "Opinions" section. Search for the case by its name or docket number to find the full text, which typically includes the case number, decision date, and the opinion's author.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I handle the unique author format when citing a Supreme Court decision in APA style?</strong></p>
<p>A: In APA format, the author of a Supreme Court decision is the name of the case, not an individual or a court. For example, use "Brown v. Board of Education" as the author in the citation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the correct way to format publication dates for Supreme Court decisions in APA citations?</strong></p>
<p>A: For Supreme Court decisions, use the year of the decision as the publication date. If you refer to a specific part of the opinion, include the full date in the in-text citation (e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 1954).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there specific URL and access requirements when citing a Supreme Court decision from an online source in APA?</strong></p>
<p>A: When citing a Supreme Court decision online, include the URL of the specific case page from the Supreme Court's official website or a reliable legal database. APA does not require a retrieval date for online legal decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing a Supreme Court decision differ from other government reports in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unlike other government reports, Supreme Court decisions use the case name as the author and the year of the decision as the publication date. Additionally, they do not require a publisher, as the court itself is sufficient, and specific URLs are used for online access.</p>
