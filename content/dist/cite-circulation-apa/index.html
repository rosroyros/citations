<h2 id="quick-reference-circulation-citations">Quick Reference: Circulation Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Circulation-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from the journal <em>Circulation</em> involves specific formatting considerations that may differ slightly from standard APA 7th edition guidelines. One notable distinction is that <em>Circulation</em> often has a larger number of authors per article. In standard APA citations, you should list up to 20 authors by last name and initials, placing an ampersand (&amp;) before the final author's name. However, with <em>Circulation</em>, it's common to encounter articles with more than 20 authors. In such cases, list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis (…), and then the last author's name, omitting any intervening authors.</p>
<p>Another area where students might find confusion is in the handling of digital object identifiers (DOIs) and URLs. APA guidelines specify that DOIs should be presented in a link format (starting with "https://doi.org/"), which is particularly relevant for <em>Circulation</em> articles that are often accessed online. Ensure that you provide the DOI if available, as it serves as a permanent link to the article. If a DOI is not available, provide the direct URL of the journal’s homepage.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should pay close attention to author listing and DOI presentation. Best practices include double-checking the publication's author list before constructing the citation and using reliable databases to verify DOI information. Familiarizing oneself with these nuances will help ensure accurate citations of <em>Circulation</em> articles, maintaining academic integrity and clarity in scholarly writing.</p>
<p><strong>In-Text Citation:</strong><br />
- Parenthetical: ([Author], [Year])<br />
- Narrative: [Author] ([Year])</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong><br />

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-circulation">Where to Find Citation Information on Circulation</h2>
<p>Circulation is a prominent journal in the field of cardiology, and accessing citation information from its articles is crucial for academic research. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the Circulation website efficiently to find the necessary citation details: author, publication date, article title, and URL/access information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing Circulation</strong>: Start by visiting the Circulation website directly rather than through a search engine. Type "Circulation" into your browser's address bar, or use a search engine to locate the journal if you’re unsure of the URL. Once on the site, use the search bar to find the specific article you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding the Author’s Name</strong>: On the Circulation article page, the author's name is typically located at the top of the article, just below the title. Look for an author byline, which may include multiple authors. If there are several, list them in the order they appear for your citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locating the Publication Date</strong>: The publication date is usually displayed directly under the author’s byline or near the top of the article page, just below the article title. It typically includes the day, month, and year of publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying the Article Title</strong>: The title of the article is prominently displayed at the top of the article page. It appears in a larger font size than the rest of the text, making it easy to spot. Ensure you copy the title exactly as it appears, including any subtitles or punctuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing the URL</strong>: To find the URL, look in your browser's address bar at the top of the screen. This is the direct link to the article and should be copied exactly as it appears. Ensure that you have access to the full article, as Circulation may require a subscription or institutional login for full-text access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Tips</strong>: Circulation articles often include a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is a stable, unique identifier for electronic documents. If available, locate the DOI near the top of the article page, often close to the publication date or author information, as this can be useful for citations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you will be able to efficiently gather citation information from Circulation articles. This process will enhance the accuracy and credibility of your academic work, ensuring compliance with APA 7th edition guidelines or any other citation format you are required to use.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-circulation">Common Issues When Citing Circulation</h2>
<p>Certainly! Let's explore common citation problems students face when citing articles from "Circulation," a journal published by the American Heart Association, and provide practical solutions.</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-finding-authors">Problem 1: Finding Authors</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Students often struggle with identifying the correct authors of an article from "Circulation." This can be challenging due to the presence of numerous contributors, such as researchers, reviewers, and editorial staff, presented in the publication.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens">Why It Happens</h4>
<p>"Circulation" often features articles with multiple authors, sometimes listed in a complex format. This can lead to confusion over which contributors to include in the citation.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access the Article</strong>: Go to the article’s landing page on the "Circulation" website.</li>
<li><strong>Identify the Authors</strong>: Look for the section typically labeled "Authors" or "Authors and Affiliations." Only include those listed under this section in your citation.</li>
<li><strong>Follow APA Format</strong>: In APA 7th edition, list up to 20 authors by their last name followed by initials. If there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19, insert an ellipsis (…), and then add the final author’s name.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Before</strong>: Smith, J., et al. (2023).<br />
<strong>Example After</strong>: Smith, J., Johnson, A., Williams, R., Brown, T., Jones, L., Miller, D., Wilson, P., Moore, S., Taylor, K., Anderson, L., Thomas, Q., Jackson, R., White, C., Harris, M., Martin, E., Thompson, F., Garcia, B., Martinez, N., &amp; Rodriguez, H. (2023).</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description_1">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Students may incorrectly format the publication date, which is crucial for proper APA citation.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens_1">Why It Happens</h4>
<p>"Circulation" articles often display multiple dates, such as acceptance, online publication, and print publication dates. This can lead to confusion about which date is appropriate for citation.</p>
<h4 id="solution_1">Solution</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the Most Recent Date</strong>: Typically, use the online publication date as it reflects when the article became accessible to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Format the Date Correctly</strong>: In APA, present the date in year, month day format, such as (2023, August 15).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Before</strong>: (2023/08/15)<br />
<strong>Example After</strong>: (2023, August 15)</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description_2">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Students often face difficulties in properly including URLs in their citations, especially when permalinks or DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) are involved.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens_2">Why It Happens</h4>
<p>"Circulation" articles are frequently accessed online, and students might confuse URLs with DOIs or omit them entirely.</p>
<h4 id="solution_2">Solution</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use DOIs First</strong>: If a DOI is available, prefer it over a URL. Format it as a hyperlink starting with "https://doi.org/".</li>
<li><strong>Include URLs if No DOI</strong>: Use the full URL for the article’s landing page if no DOI is available.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Accessibility</strong>: Ensure that the URL or DOI leads directly to the article without requiring additional navigation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example Before</strong>: www.circulationjournal.org/article/12345<br />
<strong>Example After</strong>: https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.12345</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="issue-description_3">Issue Description</h4>
<p>Students may cite articles without considering access restrictions, leading to citations that others can't verify.</p>
<h4 id="why-it-happens_3">Why It Happens</h4>
<p>"Circulation" articles may require subscriptions or institutional access, which can be overlooked when citing.</p>
<h4 id="solution_3">Solution</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify Access</strong>: Confirm whether the article is open-access or behind a paywall.</li>
<li><strong>Indicate Access Restrictions</strong>: If the article is not freely accessible, mention this in your work, especially if sharing with others who might not have access.</li>
<li><strong>Use Institutional Access</strong>: Whenever possible, use institutional login or library resources to access articles, ensuring you have the necessary permissions to cite them.</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these common citation issues, students can ensure their references from "Circulation" are accurate and adhere to APA 7th edition guidelines. This not only enhances the credibility of their work but also facilitates verification and further research by others.</p>
