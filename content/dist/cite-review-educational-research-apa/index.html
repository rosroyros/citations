Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Review of Educational Research-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing articles from "Review of Educational Research" (RER) in APA 7th edition follows the general format for journal articles but with attention to a few specifics. In a typical APA citation, you list up to 20 authors, providing the last name followed by initials, separated by commas, and an ampersand before the last author. However, RER articles often involve extensive literature reviews, potentially leading to long author lists, which the APA 7th edition accommodates. Always ensure to include all authors up to 20 in the reference list, as omitting authors is a common error.</p>
<p>Specific to RER, the journal’s comprehensive reviews might lead students to mistakenly treat them as edited volumes or books rather than articles. This confusion can cause incorrect formatting that omits necessary components such as the journal title, volume, issue number, and page range. Unlike edited books, articles in RER should always include the volume and issue number following the journal title in italics, ensuring clarity and consistency.</p>
<p>To avoid mistakes, verify the journal's title, volume, and issue number directly from the RER publication, as these elements are crucial for accurate citations. Additionally, pay careful attention to the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which is essential in APA citations. Always use the format: https://doi.org/xxxx. By adhering to these guidelines, students can ensure their citations are precise and reflect the scholarly rigor of RER articles.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-find-citation-information-on-review-of-educational-research">Where to Find Citation Information on Review of Educational Research</h2>
<p>Navigating the Review of Educational Research (RER) journal website for citation information is a straightforward task if you know where to look. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you locate the necessary citation details such as author, publication date, title, and URL/access information.</p>
<p><strong>1. Locating the Author:</strong><br />
Once you have accessed the article page on the RER website, the author's name(s) can be found prominently displayed near the top of the article. Specifically, look for the byline, which is usually situated just below the article title. The authors' names are typically hyperlinked, allowing you to explore their other publications and credentials.</p>
<p><strong>2. Finding the Publication Date:</strong><br />
The publication date is usually positioned close to the top of the article page. On the RER website, you can find the date immediately beneath the authors’ names or the article title. It is often formatted as "Month Day, Year," which is standard on the Sage Publishing platform hosting RER. This date is crucial for your citation, as it indicates when the research was published or made available online.</p>
<p><strong>3. Identifying the Article Title:</strong><br />
The article title is prominently displayed at the top of the article page in large, bold text. It is typically the first piece of information you see when you open the article, making it easy to identify and include in your citation.</p>
<p><strong>4. Accessing the URL:</strong><br />
The URL, which is essential for directing readers to the specific article, is located in your browser's address bar at the top of your web browser. When crafting your citation, ensure you copy the full URL. This link is unique to the article and provides direct access for others to view the source, especially in digital citations.</p>
<p><strong>5. Additional Details:</strong><br />
On the RER website, you may also find a "Cite" or "Citation" tool, often located on the right side of the article page or within the article tools menu. This tool can provide preformatted citations in various styles, including APA, which may simplify your process. However, always verify that these automatically generated citations adhere to the latest APA 7th edition guidelines.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you can efficiently gather all the necessary citation information from the Review of Educational Research website. This systematic approach ensures that your citations are complete and accurate, enhancing the credibility and reliability of your academic work.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-review-of-educational-research">Common Issues When Citing Review of Educational Research</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often face difficulties in correctly identifying authors when citing articles from the <em>Review of Educational Research</em>. This can occur because articles may have multiple authors, or the author list might include both individuals and organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Review of Educational Research</em> often features collaborative research, leading to lengthy author lists. Additionally, some articles might have contributions from research institutions, which can be mistakenly cited as authors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Locate the Author Section:</strong> Begin by examining the article's title page or the beginning of the article, where authors are typically listed.<br />
2. <strong>Identify Individual Authors:</strong> List all individual authors in the order they appear. Use last names followed by initials.<br />
3. <strong>Include Group Authors if Applicable:</strong> If the article lists an organization as an author, include it as a group author.<br />
4. <strong>Check for Corresponding Author Notes:</strong> These notes can help confirm the primary contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A.<br />
<strong>After Example:</strong><br />
Doe, J., Smith, A., &amp; Educational Research Institute.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Incorrect date formatting is common, especially when students encounter articles that have multiple publication dates like online first and print publication dates.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The <em>Review of Educational Research</em> may publish articles online before they appear in print, leading to confusion over which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use the Most Recent Date:</strong> For APA citations, use the year of the most recent publication format, typically the online publication date if available.<br />
2. <strong>Find the Publication Date:</strong> Check the article's information section for a clear publication date, usually indicated near the title or author information.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
(2020, March).<br />
<strong>After Example:</strong><br />
(2023).</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-url-handling">Problem 3: URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with how to include URLs when citing articles, especially considering the journal's use of DOIs.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles from the <em>Review of Educational Research</em> are often accessed via institutional access or databases, not via a direct URL. Additionally, DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is the preferred method for citation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Use DOI Instead of URL:</strong> Locate the DOI, which is usually provided with the article details. This is a stable link and preferred over a URL.<br />
2. <strong>Format the DOI Correctly:</strong> Use the format "https://doi.org/xxxxx" for APA citations.</p>
<p><strong>Before Example:</strong><br />
Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com<br />
<strong>After Example:</strong><br />
https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654320938123</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often cite articles without considering access requirements, leading to broken links or inaccessible sources for their readers.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The <em>Review of Educational Research</em> is typically accessed through institutional subscriptions, which may not be available to all readers.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Do Not Include Retrieval Dates:</strong> In APA 7th edition, retrieval dates are not necessary unless the content is expected to change over time.<br />
2. <strong>Use Institutional Access Information:</strong> If necessary, inform readers about how to access the article through institutional libraries or databases.<br />
3. <strong>Ensure DOI is Correct:</strong> As a DOI provides a stable and consistent way to access an article, double-check that it is correct and functioning.</p>
<p>By focusing on these key areas, students can overcome common citation challenges specific to the <em>Review of Educational Research</em>, ensuring their references are accurate and accessible.</p>
