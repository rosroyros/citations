<p><strong>Clinical Infectious Diseases-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from Clinical Infectious Diseases in APA 7th edition, there are a few nuances that students should be aware of to ensure accuracy. Unlike the standard APA format, which lists up to 20 authors by their last name and initials, Clinical Infectious Diseases requires authors to abide by the journal's specific citation style. This often involves using the Vancouver style, which is more concise, listing only the first six authors followed by "et al." for any additional authors. It's essential to check whether you're citing for a general academic paper or adhering to the journal's submission standards.</p>
<p>One common point of confusion is the order and format of the authors' names. Students often mistakenly follow APA's guidance without considering the journal's preference for listing a limited number of authors. Additionally, Clinical Infectious Diseases often requires including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the cited works, which aligns with APA but might differ in placement and format. Ensuring the correct inclusion of volume, issue, and page numbers is also crucial, as these details are sometimes overlooked but are vital for precision.</p>
<p>Best practices include thoroughly reviewing the specific citation guidelines provided by Clinical Infectious Diseases before finalizing your references. Consulting the journal's guide for authors or seeking examples of properly formatted citations from recent issues can provide clarity. Always cross-check your citation details with the original article to avoid discrepancies. This diligence will not only ensure compliance with Clinical Infectious Diseases standards but also improve the credibility of your academic work.</p>

   - Once you find the relevant article, click on its title to view the full text. The author byline is typically located at the top of the article, directly below the title. Authors are usually listed in the order of their contribution to the research.</p>
<p><strong>4. Finding the Publication Date:</strong><br />

<p><strong>5. Article Title:</strong><br />
   - The title of the article is prominently displayed at the top of the page. Ensure you record it exactly as it appears, including any subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>6. Accessing the URL:</strong><br />
   - The URL of the article is visible in the browser's address bar. Copy this link directly from the address bar to ensure accuracy. Make sure you are on the article's permanent page to avoid temporary session URLs.</p>
<p><strong>7. Additional Information:</strong><br />
   - If you need further citation details, such as volume or issue number, these can often be found in a sidebar or at the bottom of the article page labeled as "Journal Information" or within a citation export tool provided on the page.</p>
<p><strong>8. Using Citation Tools:</strong><br />
   - CID articles may include a tool or link labeled "Cite" or "Export Citation," which allows you to download or view citation details in various formats, including APA. This feature is beneficial for ensuring accuracy and can often be found near the article abstract or in a sidebar.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-clinical-infectious-diseases">Common Issues When Citing Clinical Infectious Diseases</h2>
<h3 id="problem-1-identifying-authors">Problem 1: Identifying Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify the authors of articles in the journal <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>. This can occur due to the presence of multiple authors and the format in which they are listed.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Articles in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em> often have numerous contributing authors, sometimes exceeding twenty. Additionally, the format used on the journal's webpage might list authors in a compact or non-traditional format, such as using "et al." after the first few authors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the full-text version of the article either via a library database or the journal's website.<br />
2. Look for the "Authors" section typically located at the beginning of the article, before the abstract or within the article's metadata.<br />
3. List the first 20 authors as they appear, followed by an ellipsis (…), and then include the last author if the list exceeds 20.<br />
4. Ensure to correctly format as per APA: Last name, First initial(s).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., Johnson, K., et al.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Johnson, K., Brown, L., Davis, M., Wilson, R., Taylor, P., Anderson, C., Thomas, E., Jackson, D., White, A., Harris, N., Martin, B., Thompson, G., Garcia, H., Martinez, I., Robinson, S., Clark, J., Rodriguez, E., Lewis, F., … Walker, R.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-date-formats">Problem 2: Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Using the correct date format is another common problem, especially when students encounter discrepancies between publication and online access dates.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em> may provide several dates: the date of online publication, the print publication date, and sometimes a date of access. Students might confuse these or use them interchangeably.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Identify the "published online" date, which is the most relevant for citation.<br />
2. Format the date as follows in APA: Year, Month Day (e.g., 2023, May 15).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> 15-05-2023<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> 2023, May 15</p>
<h3 id="problem-3-handling-urls">Problem 3: Handling URLs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often mismanage the inclusion of URLs, particularly when distinguishing between DOIs and URLs in citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em> articles may provide both a DOI and a URL. Students might not know which to prioritize or how to format them correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always prioritize the DOI over a URL if available.<br />
2. Format the DOI as a hyperlink: https://doi.org/xxxx.<br />
3. If a DOI is unavailable, provide the stable URL of the journal article.<br />
4. Avoid using URLs from library databases as they may not be accessible to all readers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2023/05/15/cid.ciaa1234<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1234</p>
<h3 id="problem-4-access-requirements">Problem 4: Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may overlook access restrictions and assume all URLs are accessible, leading to issues with reproducibility.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Access to <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em> articles may be restricted to institutional subscribers or require a personal login, which can mislead students regarding what URLs to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Verify access by attempting to view the article in a private browser session, without institutional access.<br />
2. Use proxy URLs if your institution provides them for access, but do not include these in citations.<br />
3. Prefer DOI links, which do not change with access and remain stable over time.</p>
<p>By addressing these citation issues, students can accurately and consistently cite articles from <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>, ensuring clarity and reliability in their academic work.</p>
