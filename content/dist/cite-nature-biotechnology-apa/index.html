<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>Nature Biotechnology-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
When citing articles from <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>, students should be aware that this journal follows a specific citation style that differs in several ways from the typical APA format. One key distinction is the formatting of author names. Unlike the APA style, which lists up to 20 authors using the last name followed by initials, <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> uses a more condensed format, listing only the first six authors followed by "et al." if there are more than six authors. This can be confusing for students accustomed to the APA format, which allows for listing all authors up to 20, and then using an ellipsis with the last author's name.</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> requires the inclusion of article titles in sentence case, unlike APA's title case for journal articles. The journal name should be italicized, followed by the volume number also in italics, and the issue number in parentheses (not italicized). Students often trip over these nuances, especially the placement and formatting of volume and issue numbers, which differ slightly from APA's guidelines.</p>
<p>To avoid common mistakes, students should double-check the citation format against <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> examples and guidelines. A best practice is to consult the journal's specific instructions for authors or use citation management tools that support <em>Nature Biotechnology</em> formatting. Familiarizing themselves with these distinct requirements will help students accurately cite sources and adhere to the journal's standards.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-nature-biotechnology">Common Issues When Citing Nature Biotechnology</h2>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle to correctly identify all authors when citing articles from <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>. This is due to the journal's practice of listing numerous contributors, sometimes with designations like "et al." in initial references.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Nature Biotechnology</em> frequently features collaborative research involving multiple authors. The journal's format might initially display only a few names, leading students to miss additional contributors listed elsewhere in the article or in supplementary materials.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Access the full article text, not just the abstract or summary.<br />
2. Scroll to the end of the article where the full list of authors is usually provided.<br />
3. Look for "Author Information" or "Contributions" sections that elaborate on author roles.<br />
4. Use the complete list of authors for your citation.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Smith, J., &amp; Johnson, L.<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Smith, J., Johnson, L., Brown, M., &amp; Zhang, Y.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often misformat dates when citing articles from <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>, either by using the wrong date or formatting it incorrectly according to APA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The journal may display multiple dates, such as submission, acceptance, and online publication dates, which can confuse students about which date to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Use the "Published online" date for the APA citation.<br />
2. Format the date as Year, Month Day (e.g., 2023, September 15).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> (2023, 9/15)<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> (2023, September 15)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Incorrect handling of URLs in citations, such as omitting them or incorrectly formatting them, is a frequent problem.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
Students may not realize that the APA format requires URLs for articles accessed online, or they might copy incomplete URLs from the browser's address bar.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Always include the DOI or URL at the end of the citation if the article was accessed online.<br />
2. Use the full URL or DOI link provided by the publisher, often found in the article's citation tools or DOI section.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Retrieved from www.nature.com/articles/naturebiotech12345<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-12345-6</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may not account for access restrictions, leading to citations that are not retrievable by readers.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
<em>Nature Biotechnology</em> articles may be behind paywalls, requiring access through institutional logins or subscriptions, which students might not disclose in their citations.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
1. Indicate if an article is part of a subscription service if relevant.<br />
2. Use institutional access tools to ensure you have the correct retrieval information.<br />
3. If a direct link is not available, mention the database or platform through which the article was accessed.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
- <strong>Before:</strong> Nature Biotechnology, retrieved from publisher<br />
- <strong>After:</strong> Available from Nature Biotechnology database through [University Library Name]</p>
