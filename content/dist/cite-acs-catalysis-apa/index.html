<h2 id="quick-reference-acs-catalysis-citations">Quick Reference: ACS Catalysis Citations</h2>
<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>ACS Catalysis-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing sources from ACS Catalysis follows the American Chemical Society (ACS) style, which has unique citation formatting requirements compared to more commonly used formats like APA or MLA. In ACS style, references are numbered sequentially in the text and correspond to a numbered list at the end of the document. For articles in ACS Catalysis, authors' names are formatted with last names followed by initials without periods or spaces, and up to 20 authors can be listed before using "et al." if there are more. The article title is written in sentence case and is followed by the journal name in italics, the year of publication in bold, volume number in italics, and pages. An example citation might look like this: Smith, J. A.; Brown, B. C.; Johnson, C. D. et al. Title of the Article. ACS Catal. 2020, 10, 1234-1245.</p>
<p>Where ACS Catalysis differs significantly from standard citation rules is in the structuring of author names and the use of italics and bold formatting for different elements of the citation. Unlike APA, which limits the number of authors listed to 20 before using "et al.," ACS does not have a set limit but often uses "et al." for practical reasons after many authors. Students often confuse the order of elements and the specific formatting, such as forgetting to italicize the journal name or bold the year, which can lead to incorrect citations.</p>
<p>To avoid these common pitfalls, students should pay close attention to the specific formatting details of ACS style. Double-checking each part of the citation for proper italics, bolding, and the sequence of elements is crucial. It's also beneficial to utilize citation management tools or software that supports ACS style, as these can help automate the formatting process and reduce errors. Always refer to the latest ACS style guide, as citation formats can be updated.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-acs-catalysis">Common Issues When Citing ACS Catalysis</h2>
<p>When citing articles from ACS Catalysis, students often encounter several challenges that can complicate the citation process. Below are some common issues, explanations for why they occur, and practical solutions to address them.</p>
<h3 id="finding-authors">Finding Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students may struggle to correctly identify all authors of an article, especially when there are numerous contributors. ACS Catalysis articles often have multiple authors, listed with full names, which can lead to confusion about the correct order and formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
The challenge arises from the varying presentation of author names in online listings and PDFs. ACS Catalysis typically lists authors with their full names, but without clear demarcations between first and last names, particularly for names from cultures with different naming conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
To address this, students should always refer to the official article webpage on the ACS Publications site, which provides a clear list of authors. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the article's page on the ACS Catalysis website.</li>
<li>Locate the "Authors" section, usually at the top of the abstract.</li>
<li>Copy the names exactly as they appear in the order provided.</li>
<li>Ensure that the names are formatted correctly in APA style: Last Name, First Initial(s). (e.g., Smith, J. D.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> John Smith and Jane Doe</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> Smith, J. D., &amp; Doe, J.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="date-formats">Date Formats</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying and formatting the publication date correctly, especially when pre-publication dates such as "Accepted" or "Published Online" are included.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACS Catalysis frequently updates article statuses, and students might mistakenly cite the acceptance date instead of the official publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Identify the correct publication date by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checking the article page for the "Published Date" – this is the date to use.</li>
<li>Ignore other dates such as "Accepted" or "Received."</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Accepted: March 15, 2023</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> Published: May 10, 2023</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
In APA 7th edition, students must include a URL for online sources, but some may cite URLs that are incomplete or unstable.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
URLs copied directly from the browser may include session-specific information or redirects, which are not stable over time.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
To ensure a stable URL:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the "Copy DOI" or "Copy Link" feature on the article page.</li>
<li>If unavailable, manually copy the URL, ensuring it points directly to the article landing page without session identifiers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before:</strong> https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.0c00000</li>
<li><strong>After:</strong> https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.0c00000</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Citing articles from ACS Catalysis can be problematic due to access restrictions, as some content is behind paywalls.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
ACS Catalysis is a subscription-based journal, meaning full articles are not always freely accessible, leading to incomplete citations based on abstract-only views.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
Ensure access to the full article through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using institutional access if available (e.g., university library subscriptions).</li>
<li>Looking for open-access articles or searching for preprints on platforms like arXiv.</li>
<li>Contacting the authors directly for a copy if permissible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before (abstract-only):</strong> Smith, J. D., &amp; Doe, J. (2023). Title of the article. ACS Catalysis.</li>
<li><strong>After (full access):</strong> Smith, J. D., &amp; Doe, J. (2023). Title of the article. <em>ACS Catalysis, 13</em>(4), 1234-1245. https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.0c00000</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these solutions, students can effectively navigate the unique challenges of citing ACS Catalysis articles in APA 7th edition format.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-about-acs-catalysis">Frequently Asked Questions About ACS Catalysis</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How can I find the necessary citation information on the ACS Catalysis website?</strong></p>
<p>A: Navigate to the article of interest on the ACS Catalysis website and look for the 'Cite this' option, often found near the article title or abstract. This section typically provides all the necessary details, including authors, title, journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should I format author names from an ACS Catalysis article in APA 7th edition?</strong></p>
<p>A: List author names in the order they appear, using the surname followed by the initials, with a comma between multiple authors. For instance, Brown, J. K., &amp; Smith, L. would be correctly formatted for two authors.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I correctly cite the publication date of an ACS Catalysis article in APA format when only the year is available?</strong></p>
<p>A: Use the year provided in the article's publication details. In the reference list, format it as (Year) immediately following the authors' names. If only the year is available, that's all you need to include.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there specific URL or access requirements for citing ACS Catalysis articles in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: Include the DOI if available, as it provides a permanent link to the article. If a DOI is not available, use the URL where the article can be accessed, ensuring it links directly to the article rather than the journal's homepage.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does citing an article from ACS Catalysis differ from other journal articles in APA format?</strong></p>
<p>A: While the general APA format for journal articles applies, ACS Catalysis articles often have multiple authors and a DOI, which should be included. Pay attention to the journal's specific format for author names and publication details, ensuring these are accurately transcribed into your citation.</p>
