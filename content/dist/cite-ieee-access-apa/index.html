<p><strong>Reference List Format:</strong><br />
Author, A. A., &amp; Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. <em>Title of Journal, volume</em>(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xxxxx</p>
<p><strong>IEEE Access-Specific Notes:</strong><br />
Citing IEEE Access in academic work requires adherence to specific formatting guidelines that differ from general citation practices. IEEE Access, a multidisciplinary, open-access journal, follows the citation style of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). In IEEE Access, citations should include the author(s), article title, journal name, volume number, article number or page range, publication year, and a DOI if available. The key difference is that IEEE style limits the number of authors listed to six, followed by "et al." if there are more than six authors, unlike the APA style which lists up to 20 authors before using an ellipsis.</p>
<p>One common point of confusion for students is the order and format of the citation elements. IEEE style requires that the authors' initials precede their last names, and the title of the article should be in quotation marks with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized. Additionally, students often struggle with differentiating between article numbers and page ranges, as IEEE Access frequently uses article numbers instead of traditional page numbers. To avoid these pitfalls, students should carefully check whether the article uses a page range or an article number and ensure they include the correct one in their citation.</p>
<p>For best practices, students should familiarize themselves with the IEEE citation style by reviewing the guidelines provided by IEEE and using citation tools that support IEEE formatting. Always double-check citations against the original article to ensure accuracy, particularly for elements like the DOI and article number. Additionally, consulting IEEE Access articles as examples can help clarify formatting nuances, ensuring students accurately and consistently cite these sources in their academic work.</p>

<h2 id="common-issues-when-citing-ieee-access">Common Issues When Citing IEEE Access</h2>
<p>Certainly! Below are common citation issues students may encounter when citing IEEE Access, along with practical solutions and examples.</p>
<h3 id="1-identifying-the-correct-authors">1. Identifying the Correct Authors</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students often struggle with identifying the correct authors in IEEE Access articles because the interface sometimes lists editors or other contributors prominently.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IEEE Access articles may have multiple contributors listed on the publication page, which can confuse students about the primary authors they should cite.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Locate the article's PDF version because it usually contains a clear list of authors on the title page.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> In the online interface, refer to the "Authors" section, which is typically straightforward but sometimes gets overshadowed by other contributor roles.<br />
- <strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-check the title page of the article PDF to confirm the authors.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before: Smith J., Editor, IEEE Access.<br />
After: Smith, J., &amp; Doe, A. (Year). Title of the article. <em>IEEE Access</em>. DOI</p>
<h3 id="2-date-formatting-issues">2. Date Formatting Issues</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Formatting dates incorrectly is a common problem, as students often use the submission or acceptance date instead of the publication date.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IEEE Access frequently displays multiple dates, such as submission, revision, acceptance, and publication, which can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the "Published" date on the article’s webpage or in the PDF document.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the publication date in the citation, following the format: (Year).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before: (2022, March 15)<br />
After: (2022)</p>
<h3 id="3-handling-urls-and-dois">3. Handling URLs and DOIs</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students might incorrectly format URLs or DOIs, especially when the DOI is not immediately visible or when they attempt to use the URL from the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IEEE Access articles often have long URLs that students mistakenly use instead of the DOI, which is the preferred and stable link format.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Search for the DOI provided on the article’s webpage—usually found under the title or in the citation section.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> Format the DOI correctly in the reference as: https://doi.org/xxxx</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Before: Retrieved from http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/XXXXXX<br />
After: https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.XXXXXX</p>
<h3 id="4-access-requirements">4. Access Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong><br />
Students sometimes face challenges accessing IEEE Access articles due to subscription requirements, leading to incomplete citations.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens:</strong><br />
IEEE Access is part of IEEE Xplore, which often requires institutional access or a subscription, and students might not have access to all articles.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
- <strong>Step 1:</strong> Access IEEE Access through your institution’s library portal, as they usually have subscriptions.<br />
- <strong>Step 2:</strong> If access is not available, consider using inter-library loans or contacting the authors via ResearchGate for a pre-print.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<p>This does not directly affect the citation format but ensures students can access full articles for complete citations.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Citing IEEE Access can be challenging due to the multiple roles of contributors, the presence of various dates, and the need for proper URL formatting. By understanding these unique aspects and following the outlined solutions, students can ensure their citations are accurate and compliant with academic standards.</p>
