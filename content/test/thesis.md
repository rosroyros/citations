## Understanding Thesis Citation Format in APA 7th Edition

Citing theses and dissertations in APA style is essential for maintaining academic integrity and providing readers with the necessary information to locate original works. This guide will explain the specific rules for citing theses in APA 7th edition format, along with practical tips and examples to help you master the process.

### Basic Format for Theses

When citing a thesis or dissertation in APA format, the following components are typically included:

1. Author's name (inverted)
2. Year of publication (in parentheses)
3. Title of the thesis (in italics)
4. Designation of the thesis (e.g., Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation)
5. Name of the institution
6. URL (if accessed online)

The general format looks like this:

**Author, A. A. (Year). Title of the thesis (Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation). Name of Institution. URL**

### Example of a Thesis Citation

Here is an example of a correctly formatted thesis citation:

**Smith, J. A. (2020). The effects of sleep on academic performance (Master's thesis). University of Learning. http://www.universityoflearning.edu/thesis/smith2020**

In this example, the author’s name is inverted, and the title is italicized. The designation indicates the level of the thesis, followed by the institution's name and the URL where the thesis can be accessed.

### Citing Theses with Multiple Authors

When dealing with a thesis that has multiple authors, the format changes slightly. For two authors, both names are inverted and separated by an ampersand (&). For three or more authors, you should list all authors in the same format. Here’s how it looks:

**Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of the thesis (Master's thesis). Name of Institution. URL**

#### Example with Two Authors

**Doe, R. L., & Johnson, M. P. (2021). The impact of technology on education (Master's thesis). University of Innovation. http://www.universityofinnovation.edu/thesis/doejohnson2021**

In this example, both authors are listed with inverted names, and the ampersand separates them.

### Importance of Accurate Citation

Accurate citations matter for several reasons:

1. **Credibility**: Proper citations show that you have conducted thorough research. This builds credibility with your audience.
2. **Avoiding Plagiarism**: Citing sources correctly helps you avoid unintentional plagiarism, which can have serious academic consequences.
3. **Reader Accessibility**: Clear citations enable readers to locate the original sources if they wish to explore further.

### Practical Tips for Citing Theses

1. **Keep It Simple**: Stick to the basic format outlined above. Complexity can lead to mistakes.
2. **Check for Updates**: Always consult the latest APA guidelines, as standards may change.
3. **Use Live Links**: If you are citing an online thesis, provide a live hyperlink, ensuring it is accessible.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Missing Elements**: Ensure you include all necessary elements of the citation. Omitting any part can lead to confusion.
- **Incorrect Author Formatting**: Remember to invert the author's name only in the reference list. This is a common mistake.
- **Improper URL Formatting**: URLs must be presented in their simplest form. Avoid adding "Retrieved from" unless absolutely necessary.

### Additional Resources

To ensure you are following APA guidelines accurately, consider using resources such as the APA Publication Manual (7th edition) or reputable online citation generators. These tools help streamline the process and reduce the likelihood of errors.

### Conclusion

Citing theses in APA format may seem daunting at first, but by following the rules outlined in this guide, you can create accurate and effective citations. Remember the importance of clarity and consistency in your citations. With practice, you will become proficient in APA citation style, enhancing the quality of your academic writing.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

## What You Need

- Access to the thesis or dissertation you want to cite
- A word processing program or note-taking app
- Basic knowledge of APA style formatting (7th edition)
- Information about the author, title, publication date, and institution
- Internet access for verifying format and examples

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating a Thesis Citation in APA 7th Edition

### 1. **Identify the Author(s)**

**Action:** Locate the author's name on the title page of the thesis. 

**Verification:** Ensure you have the full name, including any middle initials or suffixes. 

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** If the thesis is digital, you can often find the title page in the first few pages of the document.

### 2. **Format the Author's Name**

**Action:** Invert the author's name. Write the last name first, followed by a comma, then the first initial and any middle initials, each followed by a period.

**Example:** For John Smith, you will write Smith, J. For John Michael Smith, it will be Smith, J.M.

**Verification:** Check that the initials have periods but no spaces between them.

**Time Estimate:** 1 minute

**Tip for Efficiency:** Use a template to help you remember the format for different numbers of authors.

### 3. **Check for Multiple Authors**

**Action:** Determine if the thesis has more than one author. 

**Verification:** If there are two authors, both names should be inverted and separated by an ampersand (&). For example, for John Smith and Jane Doe, write Smith, J. & Doe, J.

**Time Estimate:** 2 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** If there are more than two authors, just remember the first author goes first, and follow the same format for the rest.

### 4. **Count the Authors for Longer Works**

**Action:** If the thesis has 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, followed by an ellipsis (...), and then the final author's name.

**Example:** Smith, J., Johnson, A., Brown, B., ... Williams, T.

**Verification:** Make sure the ellipsis is not italicized or bracketed and that all names are in the correct format.

**Time Estimate:** 3 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** Keep a list of authors handy while formatting to avoid confusion.

### 5. **Gather Thesis Information**

**Action:** Collect the title of the thesis, the year of publication, and the name of the institution that awarded the degree.

**Verification:** Ensure the title is in italics and properly capitalized (capitalize only the first word and any proper nouns).

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** Use a digital note-taking app to store this information as you gather it.

### 6. **Construct the Citation**

**Action:** Combine all the elements you have formatted into a single citation. Follow this format:
Author(s). (Year). *Title of the thesis* (Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation). Name of Institution.

**Example:** Smith, J. (2020). *The impact of social media on education* (Master's thesis). University of Education.

**Verification:** Double-check that the title is in italics and that periods are used correctly throughout.

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** Create a citation template with placeholders that you can fill in for different theses.

### 7. **Include the URL If Available**

**Action:** If the thesis is available online, include the URL at the end of the citation without any special formatting or punctuation.

**Example:** https://www.university.edu/thesis123

**Verification:** Ensure that the URL is live and leads to the thesis document. Do not add a period at the end.

**Time Estimate:** 2 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** Use a URL shortener if the link is excessively long, but ensure it remains functional.

### 8. **Review Your Citation**

**Action:** Go through your citation carefully, checking for formatting errors, missing periods, or incorrect names.

**Verification:** Compare your citation to APA formatting guidelines or examples to ensure accuracy.

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes

**Tip for Efficiency:** Use an online citation generator to cross-check your work, but always verify the final output.

By following these steps, you'll be able to create accurate and properly formatted thesis citations in APA 7th edition. Remember to take your time and refer back to this guide as needed. Happy citing!

## Validation Checklist

<div class="checklist">
<p>Before submitting your Thesis Citation citation, verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>In APA 7th edition, single authors are formatted with last name followed by a comma and first and middle initials. The initials should be separated by periods but not spaces. This format applies to all reference types including journal articles, books, and webpages. The author's name should be inverted (last name first) in the reference list only. This rule ensures consistency across all citation formats and makes alphabetical ordering more efficient in reference lists.</li>
<li>For works with two authors, both names should be inverted (last name first) and separated by an ampersand (&) rather than the word 'and'. Each author's name follows the single author format (Last name, initials). The ampersand should be preceded by a comma. This format is used in both reference lists and parenthetical citations, but narrative citations use 'and' instead of '&'. This rule distinguishes APA from other citation styles and maintains consistency across multi-author works.</li>
<li>For works with 21 or more authors, list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis (...), then list the final author. The ellipsis replaces authors 20 through the second-to-last author. All listed authors follow the standard inverted format. This rule prevents extremely long citation lists while still providing key attribution information. The ellipsis should not be italicized or bracketed. This change from APA 6th edition's 7+ author rule provides more comprehensive author listing.</li>
<li>Author titles, suffixes, and credentials (like Jr., Sr., II, III, Ph.D., M.D.) should be included in the reference list. Suffixes like Jr., Sr., II, and III follow the initials, separated by commas. Academic and professional credentials are generally omitted from reference list entries but may be included in special circumstances. Titles like Dr., Professor, or military ranks are not included in reference list citations. This rule provides complete identification when needed while avoiding unnecessary credential inflation.</li>
<li>When including URLs for websites, online documents, or other sources without DOIs, present them as live hyperlinks without any special formatting or punctuation. APA 7 removes the 'Retrieved from' prefix that was required in APA 6 for most URLs. URLs should be presented in their simplest form, beginning with http:// or https://, and should be hyperlinks in digital documents. Do not add a period at the end of a URL unless it is part of the original URL. This simplification makes citations cleaner while maintaining functionality for digital access to sources.</li>
<li>When a URL or DOI leads to a broken or inactive link, APA 7 provides several options for handling the citation. If the source is available through an archive like the Internet Archive, include the archived URL. If the source cannot be located, include as much information as possible and note that the resource is no longer available. For journal articles with broken DOIs, include the DOI but add a note indicating it's inactive. The principle is to provide enough information for readers to locate the source if possible, while acknowledging access limitations. This represents more detailed guidance than APA 6 provided for handling broken links.</li>
</ul>

## Special Cases

## Understanding Thesis Citations in APA 7th Edition

Citing theses and dissertations in APA 7th edition requires attention to specific formatting rules. These rules help maintain consistency and clarity in academic writing. This guide will explore special cases and edge cases that can arise when citing theses, ensuring you understand how to navigate these situations effectively.

## Basic Thesis Citation Format

In APA 7th edition, the basic format for citing a thesis is as follows:

**Author, A. A. (Year). Title of thesis (Publication No. [if available]) [Master's or Doctoral thesis, Name of Institution]. Database or Archive Name.**

For example:

Smith, J. D. (2020). The impact of social media on academic performance (Publication No. 123456) [Master's thesis, University of Example]. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing.

## Special Cases in Thesis Citations

### 1. Multiple Authors

If a thesis has more than one author, the citation format changes slightly. For two authors, both names are inverted, and the authors are separated by an ampersand. For example:

**Both authors:**

Jones, A. B., & Taylor, C. D. (2021). Analyzing the effects of climate change on urban development (Publication No. 654321) [Doctoral dissertation, University of Sample]. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing.

#### Practical Tip

Always check if the thesis has multiple authors. If so, ensure you use the correct format with the ampersand, and remember that in narrative citations, you would use "and" instead of the ampersand.

### 2. More Than 21 Authors

For theses with 21 or more authors, you need to list the first 19 authors, insert an ellipsis, and then add the final author's name. This rule prevents long citations from becoming cumbersome while still acknowledging all contributors. For example:

**More than 21 authors:**

Adams, A., Baker, B., Carter, C., Davis, D., Evans, E., Fisher, F., Green, G., Harris, H., Ivers, I., Johnson, J., King, K., Lewis, L., Martin, M., Nelson, N., O'Connor, O., Parker, P., Quinn, Q., Roberts, R., Smith, S., ... Thompson, T. (2022). Exploring the implications of artificial intelligence in educational settings (Publication No. 987654) [Master's thesis, University of Research]. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing.

#### Common Pitfall

Failing to use the ellipsis correctly can lead to incomplete citations. Make sure to double-check that you only list the first 19 authors and then insert the ellipsis before the final author.

### 3. Author Suffixes

When citing a thesis, it is important to include any author suffixes such as Jr., Sr., II, or III. These should be placed after the initials and separated by commas. For instance:

**With suffix:**

Brown, J. R., & White, A. B. (2023). The role of nutrition in childhood development (Publication No. 112233) [Doctoral dissertation, University of Health]. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing.

#### Why This Matters

Including suffixes ensures proper identification of the author. This is particularly important in academic settings where multiple individuals may share similar names.

## Edge Cases in Thesis Citations

### 1. No DOI or URL

In cases where the thesis does not have a DOI or is not available online, you can still cite it. You simply omit the URL and provide the necessary information leading to the thesis. For example:

**No DOI:**

Garcia, L. M. (2021). Effects of bilingual education on student performance (Unpublished master's thesis). University of Example.

### 2. Special Circumstances for Credentials

While academic and professional credentials are generally omitted, they can be included in specific cases where they provide significant context. For instance, if a thesis is authored by a well-known expert in a field, including the title can be relevant.

**With credentials:**

Johnson, M. A., Ph.D. (2019). The effects of urbanization on local ecosystems (Publication No. 334455) [Doctoral dissertation, University of Research]. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing.

### Common Pitfall

Be cautious not to include unnecessary titles like Dr. or Professor. This can lead to cluttered citations and may deviate from APA guidelines.

## Formatting URLs

When including URLs in your thesis citations, ensure they are presented as live hyperlinks. The 'Retrieved from' prefix is no longer necessary in APA 7th edition. URLs should be clear and functional. For example:

**With URL:**

Smith, J. D. (2020). The impact of social media on academic performance. http://www.example.com/thesis

### Why This Matters

Simplifying URL formatting makes citations cleaner and easier to read. It also ensures that readers can easily access the source without confusion.

## Conclusion

In summary, understanding the special cases and edge cases when citing theses in APA 7th edition is crucial for maintaining clarity and consistency in academic writing. By following the outlined rules, you can ensure that your citations are accurate and adhere to the standards set by the APA. Always double-check your work for author names, suffixes, and formatting to avoid common pitfalls. These practices not only enhance your credibility as a writer but also support readers in locating the sources you reference.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I cite a thesis in APA format?

To cite a thesis in APA format, you need to include the author's name, year of publication, title of the thesis in italics, the designation of the thesis, and the institution that awarded the degree. For example, you would format it like this: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of thesis (Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation). Name of Institution. If available, you can also include a URL if the thesis is accessible online. Make sure to follow the specific guidelines for the type of thesis you are citing, as the format may vary slightly between master's and doctoral works.

---

### What if I cannot find the author's name for a thesis?

If the author's name is not available, you can start your citation with the title of the thesis. Use the same format as you would with an author, but place the title in the author position. For example, you might write: Title of thesis (Year). (Master's thesis). Name of Institution. However, it is essential to verify the legitimacy of the thesis and its source if the author's name is not provided. If you are using a database or website, check their guidelines or contact them for further information.

---

### How do I cite a thesis with multiple authors?

Citing a thesis with multiple authors in APA format requires you to list all authors in the order they appear in the thesis. Use an ampersand (&) before the last author's name. The format looks like this: Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of thesis (Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation). Name of Institution. Remember to adjust for the number of authors according to APA style guidelines. If there are more than 20 authors, list the first 19 followed by an ellipsis and then the final author's name.

---

### Do I need to include a retrieval date for an online thesis citation?

In APA format, you generally do not need to include a retrieval date unless the content is likely to change over time. This includes sources like wikis or webpages that are regularly updated. For most theses, if you are citing a stable document such as one found in a university repository, your citation will not need a retrieval date. The citation should include the URL of the thesis if it is available online. Ensure that the link is functional and leads directly to the document.

---

### Can I cite a thesis that I found in a database?

Yes, you can cite a thesis found in a database in APA format. The citation will generally follow the same structure as a traditional thesis citation, but you should include the name of the database from which you retrieved the thesis. For example, your citation might look like this: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of thesis (Master's thesis). Name of Institution. Database Name. If the thesis has a specific identifier, like a DOI or accession number, include that in your citation as well. This helps readers locate the original source more easily.

---

### What should I do if the thesis is unpublished?

When citing an unpublished thesis in APA format, include the same elements as a published thesis but specify that it is unpublished. Your citation should look like this: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of thesis (Unpublished Master's thesis or Unpublished Doctoral dissertation). Name of Institution. Indicating that the thesis is unpublished provides clarity to your readers on the status of the work. If you have access to the unpublished thesis, you may also include information about where it can be found, if applicable. This allows for transparency about the source.
